COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2016/1702
of 18 August 2016
amending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 as regards templates and instructions
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (1) and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 99(5), the fourth subparagraph of Article 99(6), the third subparagraph of Article 101(4) and the third subparagraph of Article 394(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (2) lays down the requirements according to which institutions are required to report information relevant to their compliance with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Given that the regulatory framework established by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is gradually being supplemented and amended in its non-essential elements by the adoption of regulatory technical standards, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 needs to be updated accordingly to reflect those rules.
(2)
In order to ensure a correct and uniform application of the requirements laid down in Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, further precision should be provided with regard to the templates and instructions including definitions used for the purposes of institutions’ supervisory reporting. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 should also be updated to correct typos, erroneous references and formatting inconsistencies which were discovered in the course of the application of that Regulation. Therefore, for reasons of legal clarity, it is appropriate to replace several templates of Annexes I, III and IV and to amend some of the instructions laid down in Annexes II, V, VII and IX.
(3)
To provide institutions and competent authorities with adequate time to implement the amendments set out in this Regulation, it should apply from 1 December 2016.
(4)
This Regulation is based on the draft implementing technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) to the Commission.
(5)
Given that the necessary amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 do not involve significant changes in substantive terms, in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), the EBA has not conducted any open public consultation, considering that it would be disproportionate in relation to the scope and impact of the draft implementing technical standards concerned.
(6)
Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
_Article 1
Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 is amended as follows:
(1)
the index and template numbers 2, 4, 7, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 18 and 21 of Annex I to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 are replaced by the index and templates set out in Annex I to this Regulation;
(2)
Annex II to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 is replaced by the text set out in Annex II to this Regulation;
(3)
template numbers 1.2, 2, 8, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 30, 31, 41, 43 and 45 of Annex III to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 are replaced by the templates set out in Annex III to this Regulation;
(4)
Annex IV to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 is replaced by the text set out in Annex IV to this Regulation;
(5)
Annex V to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 is replaced by the text set out in Annex V to this Regulation;
(6)
Annex VII to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 is replaced by the text set out in Annex VI to this Regulation;
(7)
Annex IX to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 is replaced by the text set out in Annex VII to this Regulation.
_Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 1 December 2016 with the first reporting reference date being 31 December 2016.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Brussels, 18 August 2016.

PART I:   GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
1.   STRUCTURE AND CONVENTIONS
1.1.   STRUCTURE
1.
Overall, the framework consists of five blocks of templates:
(a)
capital adequacy, an overview of regulatory capital; total risk exposure amount;
(b)
group solvency, an overview of the fulfilment of the solvency requirements by all individual entities included in the scope of consolidation of the reporting entity
(c)
credit risk (including counterparty, dilution and settlement risks);
(d)
market risk (including position risk in trading book, foreign exchange risk, commodities risk and CVA risk);
(e)
operational risk.
2.
For each template legal references are provided. Further detailed information regarding more general aspects of the reporting of each block of templates, instructions concerning specific positions as well as validation rules are included in this part of the Implementing Technical Standard..
3.
Institutions report only those templates that are relevant depending on the approach used for determining own funds requirements.
1.2.   NUMBERING CONVENTION
4.
The document follows the labelling convention set in the following table, when referring to the columns, rows and cells of the templates. These numerical codes are extensively used in the validation rules.
5.
The following general notation is followed in the instructions: {Template;Row;Column}.
6.
In the case of validations inside a template, in which only data points of that template is used, notations do not refer to a template: {Row;Column}.
7.
In the case of templates with only one column, only rows are referred to. {Template;Row}
8.
An asterisk sign is used to express that the validation is done for the rows or columns specified before.
1.3.   SIGN CONVENTION
9.
Any amount that increases the own funds or the capital requirements shall be reported as a positive figure. On the contrary, any amount that reduces the total own funds or the capital requirements shall be reported as a negative figure. Where there is a negative sign (-) preceding the label of an item no positive figure is expected to be reported for that item.
PART II:   TEMPLATE RELATED INSTRUCTIONS
1.   CAPITAL ADEQUACY OVERVIEW (CA)
1.1.   GENERAL REMARKS
10.
CA templates contain information about Pillar 1 numerators (own funds, Tier 1, Common Equity Tier 1), denominator (own funds requirements), and transitional provisions and is structures in five templates:
a)
CA1 template contains the amount of own funds of the institutions, disaggregated in the items needed to get to that amount. The amount of own funds obtained includes the aggregate effect of transitional provisions per type of capital
b)
CA2 template summarizes the total risk exposures amounts as defined in Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (‘CRR’)
c)
CA3 template contains the ratios for which CRR state a minimum level, and some other related data
d)
CA4 template contains memorandums items needed for calculating items in CA1 as well as information with regard to the CRD capital buffers.
e)
CA5 template contains the data needed for calculating the effect of transitional provisions in own funds. CA5 will cease to exist once the transitional provisions will expire.
11.
The templates shall apply to all reporting entities, irrespective of the accounting standards followed, although some items in the numerator are specific for entities applying IAS/IFRS-type valuation rules. Generally, the information in the denominator is linked to the final results reported in the correspondent templates for the calculation of the total risk exposure amount.
12.
The total own funds consist of different types of capital: Tier 1 capital (T1), which is the sum of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1) as well as Tier 2 capital (T2).
13.
Transitional provisions are treated as follows in CA templates:
a)
The items in CA1 are generally gross of transitional adjustments. This means that figures in CA1 items are calculated according to the final provisions (i.e. as if there were no transitional provisions), with the exception of items summarizing the effect of the transitional provisions. For each type of capital (i.e. CET1; AT1 and T2) there are three different items in which all the adjustments due to transitional provisions are included.
b)
Transitional provisions may also affect the AT1 and the T2 shortfall (i.e. AT1 or T2 the excess of deduction, regulated in articles 36(1) point (j) and 56 point (e) of CRR respectively), and thus the items containing these shortfalls may indirectly reflect the effect of transitional provisions.
c)
Template CA5 is exclusively used for reporting the transitional provisions.
14.
The treatment of Pillar II requirements can be different within the EU (Article 104(2) CRD IV has to be transposed into national regulation). Only the impact of Pillar II requirements on the solvency ratio or the target ratio shall be included in the solvency reporting of CRR. A detailed reporting of Pillar II requirements is not within the mandate of Article 99 CRR.
a)
The templates CA1, CA2 or CA5 only contain data on Pillar I issues.
b)
The template CA3 contains the impact of additional Pillar II-requirements on the solvency ratio on an aggregated basis. One block focuses on the impact of amounts on the ratios, whereas the other block focuses on the ratio itself. Both blocks of ratios do not have any further link to the templates CA1, CA2 or CA5.
c)
The template CA4 contains one cell regarding additional own funds requirements relating to Pillar II. This cell has no link via validation rules to the capital ratios of the CA3 template and reflects Article 104(2) CRD which explicitly mentions additional own funds requirements as one possibility for Pillar II decisions.

1.6.   TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND GRANDFATHERED INSTRUMENTS: INSTRUMENTS NOT CONSTITUTING STATE AID (CA 5)
1.6.1.   General remarks
15.
CA5 summarizes the calculation of own funds elements and deductions subject to the transitional provisions laid down in Articles 465 to 491 of CRR.
16.
CA5 is structured as follows:
a.
Template 5.1 summarizes the total adjustments which need to be made to the different components of own funds (reported in CA1 according to the final provisions) as a consequence of the application of the transitional provisions. The elements of this table are presented as ‘adjustments’ to the different capital components in CA1, in order to reflect in own funds components the effects of the transitional provisions.
b.
Template 5.2 provides further details on the calculation of those grandfathered instruments which do not constitute state aid.
17.
Institutions shall report in the first four columns the adjustments to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital as well as the amount to be treated as risk weighted assets. Institutions are also required to report the applicable percentage in column 050 and the eligible amount without the recognition of transitional provisions in column 060.
18.
Institutions shall only report elements in CA5 during the period where transitional provisions in accordance with Part Ten of CRR apply.
19.
Some of the transitional provisions require a deduction from Tier 1. If this is the case the residual amount of a deduction or deductions is applied to Tier 1 and there is insufficient AT1 to absorb this amount then the excess shall be deducted from CET1.
1.6.2.   C 05.01 — Transitional provisions (CA5.1)
20.
Institutions shall report in Table 5.1 the transitional provisions to own funds components as laid down in Articles 465 to 491 of CRR, compared to applying the final provisions laid down in Title II of Part Two of CRR.
21.
Institutions shall report in rows 020 to 060 information in relation with the transitional provisions of grandfathered instruments. The figures to be reported in columns 010 to 030 of row 060 of CA 5.1 can be derived from the respective sections of CA 5.2.
22.
Institutions shall report in rows 070 to 092 information in relation with the transitional provisions of minority interests and additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments issued by subsidiaries (in accordance with Articles 479 and 480 of CRR).
23.
In rows 100 onwards institutions shall report information in relation with the transitional provisions of unrealized gains and losses, deductions as well as additional filters and deductions.
24.
There might be cases where the transitional deductions of CET1, AT1 or T2 capital exceed the CET1, AT1 or T2 capital of an institution. This effect – if it results from transitional provisions – shall be shown in the CA1 template using the respective cells. As a consequence, the adjustments in the columns of the CA5 template do not include any spill-over effects in the case of insufficient capital available.

2.   GROUP SOLVENCY: INFORMATION ON AFFILIATES (GS)
2.1.   GENERAL REMARKS
26.
Templates C 06.01 and C 06.02 shall be reported if own funds requirements are calculated on a consolidated basis. This template consists of four parts in order to gather different information on all individual entities (including the reporting institution) included in the scope of consolidation.
a)
Entities within the scope of consolidation;
b)
Detailed group solvency information;
c)
Information on the contribution of individual entities to group solvency;
d)
Information on capital buffers;
27.
Institutions waived according to Article 7 of CRR shall only report the columns 010 to 060 and 250 to 400.
2.2.   DETAILED GROUP SOLVENCY INFORMATION
28.
The second part of this template (detailed group solvency information) in columns 070 to 210 is designed to gather information on credit and other regulated financial institutions which are effectively subject to particular solvency requirements on individual basis. It provides, for each of those entities within the scope of the reporting, the own funds requirements for each risk category and the own funds for solvency purposes.
29.
In the case of proportional consolidation of participations, the figures related to own funds requirements and own funds shall reflect the respective proportional amounts.
2.3.   INFORMATION ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES TO GROUP SOLVENCY
30.
The objective of the third part of this template (information on the contributions of all entities within CRR scope of consolidation to group solvency), including those that are not subject to particular solvency requirements on an individual basis, in columns 250 to 400, is to identify which entities within the group generate the risks and raise own funds from the market, based on data that are readily available or can easily be reprocessed, without having to reconstruct the capital ratio on a solo or sub-consolidated basis. At the entity level, both risk and own fund figures are contributions to the group figures and not elements of a solvency ratio on a solo basis and as such must not be compared to each other.
31.
The third part also includes the amounts of minority interests, qualifying AT1, and qualifying T2 eligible in the consolidated own funds.
32.
As this third part of the template refers to ‘contributions’, the figures to be reported herein shall defer, when applicable, from the figures reported in the columns referring to detailed group solvency information.
33.
The principle is to delete the cross-exposures within the same groups in a homogeneous way both in terms of risks or own funds, in order to cover the amounts reported in the group’s consolidated CA template by adding the amounts reported for each entity in ‘Group Solvency’ template. In cases where the 1 % threshold is not exceeded a direct link to the CA template is not possible.
34.
The institutions shall define the most appropriate breakdown method between the entities to take into account the possible diversification effects for market risk and operational risk.
35.
It is possible for one consolidated group to be included within another consolidated group. This means that the entities within a subgroup shall be reported entity-by-entity in the GS of the entire group, even if the sub-group itself is subject to reporting requirements. If the subgroup is subject to reporting requirements, it shall also report the GS template on an entity-by-entity basis, although those details are included in the GS template of a higher consolidated group.
36.
An institution shall report data of the contribution of an entity when its contribution to the total risk exposure amount exceeds 1 % of the total risk exposure amount of the group or when its contribution to the total own funds exceeds 1 % of the total own funds of the group. This threshold does not apply in the case of subsidiaries or subgroups that provide own funds (in the form of minority interests or qualifying AT1 or T2 instruments included in own funds) to the group.

NAME
Name of the entity within the scope of consolidation.
020
CODE
This code is a row identifier and shall be unique for each row in the table.
Code assigned to the entity within the scope of consolidation.
The actual composition of the code depends on the national reporting system.
025
LEI CODE
LEI code stands for Legal Entity Identification code which is a reference code proposed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and endorsed by the G20, aimed at achieving a unique and worldwide identification of parties to financial transactions.
Until the global LEI system is fully operational, pre-LEI codes are being assigned to counterparties by a Local Operational Unit that has been endorsed by Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC, detailed information may be found at the following website: www.leiroc.org)).
Where a Legal Entity Identification code (LEI code) exists for a given counterparty, it shall be used to identify that counterparty.
030
INSTITUTION OR EQUIVALENT (YES/NO)
‘YES’ shall be reported in case the entity is subject to own funds requirements according to CRD or provisions at least equivalent to Basel provisions.
‘NO’ shall be reported otherwise.
Minority interests:
81(1) point (a) (ii) and 82(1) point (a) (ii)
To the effects of minority interests and AT1 and T2 instruments issued by subsidiaries, the subsidiaries whose instruments can be eligible shall be institutions or undertakings subject by virtue of applicable national law to the requirements of CRR.
040
SCOPE OF DATA: solo fully consolidated (SF) OR solo partially consolidated (SP)
‘SF’ shall be reported for individual subsidiaries fully consolidated.
‘SP’ shall be reported for individual subsidiaries partially consolidated.
050
COUNTRY CODE
Institutions shall report the two-letter country code according to ISO 3166-2.

SHARE OF HOLDING (%)
This percentage refers to the actual share of capital the parent undertaking holds in subsidiaries. In case of full consolidation of a direct subsidiary, the actual share is e.g. 70 %. In accordance with Article 4(16) of CRR, the share of holding of a subsidiary of a subsidiary to be reported results from a multiplication of the shares between the subsidiaries concerned.
070-240
INFORMATION ON ENTITIES SUBJECT TO OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENT
The section of detailed information (i.e. columns 070 to 240) shall gather information only on those entities and subgroups which, being within the scope of consolidation (Chapter 2 of Title II of Part One of CRR), are effectively subject to solvency requirements according to CRR or provisions at least equivalent to Basel provisions (i.e, reported yes in column 030).
Information shall be included about all individual institutions of a consolidated group that are subject to own funds requirements, regardless where they are located.
The information reported in this part shall be according to the local solvency rules where the institution is operating (therefore for this template it is not necessary to do a double calculation on an individual basis according to the parent institution’s rules). When local solvency rules differ from CRR and a comparable breakdown is not given, the information shall be completed where data is available in the respective granularity. Therefore, this part is a factual template that summarises the calculations that the individual institutions of a group shall carry out, bearing in mind that some of those institutions may be subject to different solvency rules.
Reporting of fixed overheads of investment firms:
Investment firms shall include own funds requirements related to fixed overheads in their calculation of capital ratio according to Articles 95, 96, 97 and 98 of CRR.

3.   CREDIT RISK TEMPLATES
3.1.   GENERAL REMARKS
37.
There are different sets of templates for the Standardised approach and the IRB approach for credit risk. Additionally, separate templates for the geographical breakdown of positions subject to credit risk shall be reported if the relevant threshold as set out in Article 5(a)(4) is exceeded.
3.1.1.   Reporting of CRM techniques with substitution effect
38.
Article 235 of CRR describes the computation procedure of the exposure which is fully protected by unfunded protection.
39.
Article 236 of CRR describes the computation procedure of exposure which is fully protected by unfunded protection in the case of full protection/partial protection — equal seniority.
40.
Articles 196, 197 and 200 of CRR regulate the funded credit protection.
41.
Reporting of exposures to obligors (immediate counterparties) and protection providers which are assigned to the same exposure class shall be done as an inflow as well as an outflow to the same exposure class.
42.
The exposure type does not change because of unfunded credit protection.
43.
If an exposure is secured by an unfunded credit protection, the secured part is assigned as an outflow e.g. in the exposure class of the obligor and as an inflow in the exposure class of the protection provider. However, the type of the exposure does not change due to the change of the exposure class.
44.
The substitution effect in the COREP reporting framework shall reflect the risk weighting treatment effectively applicable to the covered part of the exposure. As such, the covered part of the exposure is risk weighted according to the SA approach and shall be reported in the CR SA template.
3.1.2.   Reporting of Counterparty Credit Risk
45.
Exposures stemming from Counterparty Credit Risk positions shall be reported in templates CR SA or CR IRB independent from whether they are Banking Book items or Trading Book items.
3.2.   C 07.00 — CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS AND FREE DELIVERIES: STANDARDISED APPROACH TO CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (CR SA)
3.2.1.   General remarks
46.
The CR SA templates provide the necessary information on the calculation of own funds requirements for credit risk according to the standardised approach. In particular, they provide detailed information on:
a)
the distribution of the exposure values according to the different, exposure types, risk weights and exposure classes;
b)
the amount and type of credit risk mitigation techniques used for mitigating the risks.
3.2.2.   Scope of the CR SA template
47.
According to Article 112 of CRR each SA exposure shall be assigned to one of the 16 SA exposure classes in order to calculate the own funds requirements.
48.
The information in CR SA is requested for the total exposure classes and individually for each of the exposure classes as defined for the standardised approach. The total figures as well as the information of each exposure class are reported in a separate dimension.
49.
However the following positions are not within the scope of CR SA:
a)
Exposures assigned to exposure class ‘items representing securitisation positions’ according to Article 112 (m) of CRR which shall be reported in the CR SEC templates.
b)
Exposures deducted from own funds.
50.
The scope of the CR SA template covers the following own funds requirements:
a)
Credit risk in accordance with Chapter 2 (Standardised Approach) of Title II of Part Three of CRR in the banking book, among which Counterparty credit risk in accordance with Chapter 6 (Counterparty credit risk) of Title II of Part Three of CRR in the banking book;
b)
Counterparty credit risk in accordance with Chapter 6 (Counterparty credit risk) of Title II of Part Three of CRR in the trading book;
c)
Settlement risk arising from free deliveries in accordance with Article 379 of CRR in respect of all the business activities.
51.
The scope of the template are all exposures for which the own funds requirements are calculated according to part 3 title II chapter 2 of CRR in conjunction with part 3 title II chapter 4 and 6 of CRR. Institutions that apply Article 94(1) of CRR also need to report their trading book positions in this template when they apply part 3 title II chapter 2 of CRR to calculate the own funds requirements thereof (part 3 title II chapter 2 and 6 and title V of CRR). Therefore the template provides not only detailed information on the type of the exposure (e.g. on balance sheet/off balance sheet items), but also information on the allocation of risk weights within the respective exposure class.
52.
In addition CR SA includes memorandum items in rows 290 to 320 in order to collect further information about exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property and exposures in default.
53.
These memorandum items shall only be reported for the following exposure classes:
a)
Central governments or central banks (Article 112 point (a) of CRR)
b)
Regional governments or local authorities (Article 112 point (b) of CRR)
c)
Public sector entities (Article 112 point (c) of CRR)
d)
Institutions (Article 112 point (f) of CRR)
e)
Corporates (Article 112 point (g) of CRR)
f)
Retail (Article 112 point (h) of CRR).
54.
The reporting of the memorandum items affect neither the calculation of the risk weighted exposure amounts of the exposure classes according to Article 112 points a) to c) and f) to h) of CRR nor of the exposure classes according to Article 112 points i) and j) of CRR reported in CR SA.
55.
The memorandum rows provide additional information about the obligor structure of the exposure classes ‘in default’ or ‘secured by immovable property’. Exposures shall be reported in these rows wherethe obligors would have been reported in the exposure classes ‘Central governments or central banks’, ‘Regional governments or local authorities’, ‘Public sector entities’, ‘Institutions’, ‘Corporates’ and ‘Retail’ of CR SA, if those exposures were not assigned to the exposure classes ‘in default’ or ‘secured by immovable property’. However the figures reported are the same as used to calculate the risk weighted exposure amounts in the exposure classes ‘in default’ or ‘secured by immovable property.
56.
E.g. if an exposure, the risk exposure amounts of which are calculated subject to Article 127 of CRR and the value adjustments are less than 20 %, then this information is reported in CR SA, row 320 in the total and in the exposure class ‘in default’. If this exposure, before it defaulted, was an exposure to an institution then this information shall also be reported in row 320 of exposure class ‘institutions’.
3.2.3.   Assignment of exposures to exposure classes under the Standardised Approach
57.
In order to ensure a consistent categorisation of exposures into the different exposure classes as defined in Article 112 of CRR the following sequential approach shall be applied:
a)
In the first step the Original exposure pre conversion factors is classified into the corresponding (original) exposure class as referred to in Article 112 of CRR, without prejudice to the specific treatment (risk weight) that each specific exposure shall receive within the assigned exposure class.
b)
In a second step the exposures may be redistributed to other exposure classes due to the application of credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques with substitution effects on the exposure (e.g. guarantees, credit derivatives, financial collateral simple method) via inflows and outflows.
58.
The following criteria apply for the classification of the Original exposure pre conversion factors into the different exposure classes (first step) without prejudice to the subsequent redistribution caused by the use of CRM techniques with substitution effects on the exposure or to the treatment (risk weight) that each specific exposure shall receive within the assigned exposure class.
59.
For the purpose of classifying the original exposure pre conversion factor in the first step, the CRM techniques associated to the exposure shall not be considered (note that they shall be considered explicitly in the second phase) unless a protection effect is intrinsically part of the definition of an exposure class as it is the case in the exposure class mentioned in Article 112 point (i) of CRR (exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property).
60.
Article 112 of CRR does not provide criteria for disjoining the exposure classes. This might imply that one exposure could potentially be classified in different exposure classes if no prioritisation in the assessment criteria for the classification is provided. The most obvious case arises between exposures to institutions and corporate with a short-term credit assessment (Article 112 point (n) of CRR) and exposures to institutions (Article 112 point (f) of CRR)/exposures to corporates (Article 112 point (g) of CRR). In this case it is clear that there is an implicit prioritisation in the CRR since it shall be assessed first if a certain exposure fit for being assigned to Short-term exposures to institutions and corporate and only afterwards do the same process for exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates. Otherwise it is obvious that the exposure class mentioned in Article 112 point (n) of CRR shall never be assigned an exposure. The example provided is one of the most obvious examples but not the only one. It is worth noting that the criteria used for establishing the exposure classes under the standardised approach are different (institutional categorisation, term of the exposure, past due status, etc.) which is the underlying reason for non disjoint groupings.
61.
For a homogeneous and comparable reporting it is necessary to specify prioritisation assessment criteria for the assignment of the Original exposure pre conversion factor by exposure classes, without prejudice to the specific treatment (risk weight) that each specific exposure shall receive within the assigned exposure class. The prioritisation criteria presented below using a decision tree scheme are based on the assessment of the conditions explicitly laid down in the CRR for an exposure to fit in a certain exposure class and, if it is the case, on any decision on the part of the reporting institutions or the supervisor on the applicability of certain exposure classes. As such, the outcome of the exposure assignment process for reporting purposes would be in line with CRR provisions. This does not preclude institutions to apply other internal assignment procedures that may also be consistent with all relevant CRR provisions and its interpretations issued by the appropriate fora.
62.
An exposure class shall be given priority to others in the assessment ranking in the decision tree (i.e. it shall be first assessed if an exposure can be assigned to it, without prejudice to the outcome of that assessment) if otherwise no exposures would potentially be assigned to it. This would be the case when in the absence of prioritisation criteria one exposure class would be a subset of others. As such the criteria graphically depicted in the following decision tree would work on a sequential process.
63.
With this background the assessment ranking in the decision tree mentioned below would follow the following order:
1.
Securitisation positions;
2.
Items associated with particular high risk;
3.
Equity exposures
4.
Exposures in default;
5.
Exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (‘CIU’)/Exposures in the form of covered bonds (disjoint exposure classes);
6.
Exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property;
7.
Other items;
8.
Exposures to institutions and corporates with a short-term credit assessment;
9.
All other exposure classes (disjoint exposure classes) which include Exposures to central governments or central banks; Exposures to regional governments or local authorities; Exposures to public sector entities; Exposures to multilateral development banks; Exposures to international organisations; Exposures to institutions; Exposures to corporate and Retail exposures.
64.
In the case of exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings and where the look through approach (Article 132(3) to (5) of CRR) is used, the underlying individual exposures shall be considered and classified into their corresponding risk weight line according to their treatment, but all the individual exposures shall be classified within the exposure class of exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (‘CIU’).
65.
In the case of ‘nth’ to default credit derivatives specified in Article 134(6) of CRR, if they are rated, they shall be directly classified as securitisation positions. If they are not rated, they shall be considered in the ‘Other items’ exposure class. In this latter case the nominal amount of the contract shall be reported as the Original exposure pre conversion factors in the line for ‘Other risk weights’ (the risk weight used shall be that specified by the sum indicated under Article 134(6) of CRR.
66.
In a second step, as a consequence of credit risk mitigation techniques with substitution effects, exposures shall be reallocated to the exposure class of the protection provider.
DECISION TREE ON HOW TO ASSIGN THE ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE CONVERSION FACTORS TO THE EXPOSURE CLASSES OF THE STANDARDISED APPROACH ACCORDING TO CRR
Original exposure pre conversion factors


Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 (m)?

Securitisation positions



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112point (k)?

Items associated with particular high risk (also see Article 128)



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (p)?

Equity exposures (also see Article 133)



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (j)?

Exposures in default



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure classes of Article 112 points (l) and (o)?

Exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (CIU)
Exposures in the form of covered bonds (also see Article 129)
These two exposure classes are disjoint among themselves (see comments on the look-through approach in the answer above). Therefore the assignment to one of them is straightforward.



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (i)?

Exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property (also see Article 124)



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (q)?

Other items



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (n)?

Exposures to institutions and corporates with a short-term credit assessment



The exposure classes below are disjoint among themselves. Therefore the assignment to one of them is straightforward.
Exposures to central governments or central banks
Exposures to regional governments or local authorities
Exposures to public sector entities
Exposures to multilateral development banks
Exposures to international organisations
Exposures to institutions
Exposures to corporates
Retail exposures
3.2.4.   Clarifications on the scope of some specific exposure classes referred to in Article 112 of CRR
3.2.4.1.   Exposure Class ‘Institutions’
67.
Reporting of intra-group exposures according to Article 113(6) to (7) of CRR shall be done as follows:
68.
Exposures which fulfil the requirements of Article 113(7) of CRR shall be reported in the respective exposure classes where they would be reported if they were no intra-group exposures.
69.
According Article 113(6) and (7) of CRR ‘an institution may, subject to the prior approval of the competent authorities, decide not to apply the requirements of paragraph 1 of this Article to the exposures of that institution to a counterparty which is its parent undertaking, its subsidiary, a subsidiary of its parent undertaking or an undertaking linked by a relationship within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC.’ This means that intra-group counterparties are not necessarily institutions but also undertakings which are assigned to other exposure classes, e.g. ancillary services undertakings or undertakings within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 83/349/EEC. Therefore intra-group exposures shall be reported in the corresponding exposure class.
3.2.4.2.   Exposure Class ‘Covered Bonds’
70.
The assignment of SA exposures to the exposure class ‘covered bonds’ shall be done as follows:
71.
Bonds as defined in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC shall fulfil the requirements of Article 129(1) to (2) of CRR to be classified in the exposure class ‘Covered Bonds’. The fulfilment of those requirements has to be checked in each case. Nevertheless, bonds according to Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC and issued before 31 December 2007, are also assigned to the exposure class ‘Covered Bonds’ because of Article 129(6) of CRR.
3.2.4.3.   Exposure class ‘Collective Investment Undertakings’
72.
Where the possibility according to Article 132(5) of CRR is used, exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs shall be reported as on balance sheet items according to Article 111(1) sentence 1 of CRR.

3.3.   CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS AND FREE DELIVERIES: IRB APPROACH TO OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS (CR IRB)
3.3.1.   Scope of the CR IRB template
73.
The scope of the CR IRB template covers own funds requirements for:
i.
Credit risk in the banking book, among which:
—
Counterparty credit risk in the banking book;
—
Dilution risk for purchased receivables;
ii.
Counterparty credit risk in the trading book;
iii.
Free deliveries resulting from all business activities..
74.
The scope of the template refers to the exposures for which the risk weighted exposure amounts are calculated according to Articles 151 to 157 Part Three Title II Chapter 3 CRR (IRB approach).
75.
The CR IRB template does not cover the following data:
i.
Equity exposures, which are reported in the CR EQU IRB template;
ii.
Securitisation positions, which are reported in the CR SEC SA, CR SEC IRB and/or CR SEC Details templates;
iii.
‘Other non-obligation assets’, according to Article 147(2) point (g) CRR. The risk weight for this exposure class has to be set at 100 % at any time except for cash in hand, equivalent cash items and exposures that are residual values of leased assets, according to Article 156 CRR. The risk weighted exposure amounts for this exposure class are reported directly in the CA-Template;
iv.
Credit valuation adjustment risk, which is reported on the CVA Risk template;
The CR IRB template does not require a geographical breakdown of IRB exposures by residence of the counterparty. This breakdown is reported in the template CR GB.
76.
In order to clarify whether the institution uses its own estimates for LGD and/or credit conversion factors the following information shall be provided for each reported exposure class:
‘NO’
=
in case the supervisory estimates of LGD and credit conversion factors are used (Foundation IRB)
‘YES’
=
in case own estimates of LGD and credit conversion factors are used (Advanced IRB)
In any case, for the reporting of the retail portfolios ‘YES’ has to be reported.
In case an institution uses own estimates of LGDs to calculate risk weighted exposure amounts for a part of its IRB exposures as well as uses supervisory LGDs to calculate risk weighted exposure amounts for the other part of its IRB exposures, an CR IRB Total for F-IRB positions and one CR IRB Total for A-IRB positions has to be reported.
3.3.2.   Breakdown of the CR IRB template
77.
The CR IRB consists of two templates. CR IRB 1 provides a general overview of IRB exposures and the different methods to calculate total risk exposure amounts as well as a breakdown of total exposures by exposure types. CR IRB 2 provides a breakdown of total exposures assigned to obligor grades or pools. The templates CR IRB 1 and CR IRB 2 shall be reported separately for the following exposure and sub-exposure classes:
1.
Total
(The Total template must be reported for the Foundation IRB and, separately for the Advanced IRB approach.)

INTERNAL RATING SYSTEM/PD ASSIGNED TO THE OBLIGOR GRADE OR POOL (%)
The PD assigned to the obligor grade or pool to be reported shall be based on the provisions laid down in Article 180 of CRR. For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to the specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. For figures corresponding to an aggregation of obligor grades or pools (e.g. total exposures) the exposure weighted average of the PDs assigned to the obligor grades or pools included in the aggregation shall be provided. The exposure value (column 110) shall be used for the calculation of the exposure-weighted average PD.
For each individual grade or pool the PD assigned to the specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. All reported risk parameters shall be derived from the risk parameters used in the internal rating system approved by the respective competent authority.
It is neither intended nor desirable to have a supervisory master scale. If the reporting institution applies a unique rating system or is able to report according to an internal master scale, this scale is used.
Otherwise, the different rating systems shall be merged and ordered according to the following criteria: Obligor grades of the different rating systems shall be pooled and ordered from the lower PD assigned to each obligor grade to the higher. Where the institution uses a large number of grades or pools, a reduced number of grades or pools to be reported may be agreed with the competent authorities.
Institutions shall contact their competent authority in advance, if they want to report a different number of grades in comparison with the internal number of grades.
For the purposes of weighting the average PD the exposure value reported in column 110 is used. All exposures, including defaulted exposures are to be considered for the purpose of the calculation of the exposure weighted average PD (e.g. for ‘total exposure’). Defaulted exposures are those assigned to the last rating grade/s with a PD of 100 %.
020
ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE CONVERSION FACTORS
Institutions report the exposure value before taking into account any value adjustments, provisions, effects due to credit risk mitigation techniques or credit conversion factors.

Hence, CRM techniques can change the allocation of an exposure to a country. Exposures to supranational organisations shall not be assigned to the country of residence of the institution but to the geographical area ‘Other countries’ irrespective of the exposure class where the exposure to supranational organisations is assigned.
80.
Data regarding ‘original exposure pre conversion factors’ shall be reported referring to the country of residence of the immediate obligor. Data regarding ‘exposure value’ and ‘Risk weighted exposure amounts’ shall be reported as of the country of residence of the ultimate obligor.

3.4.3.1.   General remarks
81.
This table is implemented in order to receive more information regarding the elements of the institution specific countercyclical capital buffer. The information requested refers to the own funds requirements determined in accordance with Part Three, Title II and Title IV of the CRR and the geographical location for credit exposures, securitisation exposures and trading book exposures relevant for the calculation of the institution specific counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCB) in accordance with Article 140 CRD (relevant credit exposures).
82.
Information in template C 09.04 is requested for the ‘Total’ of relevant credit exposures across all jurisdictions where these exposures are located and individually for each of the jurisdictions in which relevant credit exposures are located. The total figures as well as the information of each jurisdiction are reported in a separate dimension.
83.
The threshold set in Article 5 (a) (4) of this Regulation is not relevant for the reporting of this breakdown.
84.
In order to determine the geographical location, the exposures are allocated on an immediate obligor basis as provided for in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1152/2014 of 4 June 2014 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the identification of the geographical location of the relevant credit exposures for calculating institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer rates. Therefore CRM techniques do not change the allocation of an exposure to its geographical location for the purpose of reporting information set out in this template.

3.5.1.   General remarks
85.
The CR EQU IRB template consists of two templates: CR EQU IRB 1 provides a general overview of IRB exposures of the equity exposure class and the different methods to calculate total risk exposure amounts. CR EQU IRB 2 provides a breakdown of total exposures assigned to obligor grades in the context of the PD/LGD approach. ‘CR EQU IRB’ refers to both ‘CR EQU IRB 1’ and ‘CR EQU IRB 2’ templates, as applicable, in the following instructions.
86.
The CR EQU IRB template provides information on the calculation of risk weighted exposure amounts for credit risk (Article 92(3) point (a) of CRR) according to the IRB method (Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of CRR) for equity exposures referred to in Article 147(2) point (e) of CRR.
87.
According to Article 147(6) of CRR, the following exposures shall be assigned to the equity exposure class:
a)
non-debt exposures conveying a subordinated, residual claim on the assets or income of the issuer; or
b)
debt exposures and other securities, partnerships, derivatives, or other vehicles, the economic substance of which is similar to the exposures specified in point (a).
88.
Collective investment undertakings treated according to the simple risk weight approach as referred to in Article 152 of CRR shall also be reported in the CR EQU IRB template.
89.
In accordance with Article 151(1) of CRR, institutions shall provide the CR EQU IRB template when applying one of the three approaches referred to in Article 155 of CRR:
—
the Simple Risk Weight approach,
—
the PD/LGD approach, or
—
the Internal Models approach.
Moreover, institutions applying the IRB approach shall also report in the CR EQU IRB template risk-weighted exposure amounts for those equity exposures which attract a fixed risk-weight treatment (without however being explicitly treated according to the Simple Risk Weight approach or the (temporary or permanent) partial use of the credit risk standardised approach (e.g. equity exposures attracting a risk-weight of 250 % in accordance with Article 48(4) of CRR, respectively a risk-weight of 370 % in accordance with Article 471(2) of CRR))).
90.
The following equity claims shall not be reported in the CR EQU IRB template:
—
Equity exposures in the trading book (in case where institutions are not exempted from calculating own funds requirements for trading book positions according to Article 94 of CRR).
—
Equity exposures subject to the partial use of the standardised approach (Article 150 of CRR), including:
—
Grandfathered equity exposures according to Article 495(1) of CRR,
—
Equity exposures to entities whose credit obligations are assigned a 0 % risk weight under the Standardised Approach, including those publicly sponsored entities where a 0 % risk weight can be applied (Article 150(1) point (g) of CRR),
—
Equity exposures incurred under legislated programmes to promote specified sectors of the economy that provide significant subsidies for the investment to the institution and involve some form of government oversight and restrictions on the equity investments (Article 150(1) point (h) of CRR).
—
Equity exposures to ancillary services undertakings whose risk weighted exposure amounts may be calculated according to the treatment of ‘other non credit-obligation assets’ (in accordance with Article 155(1) of CRR).
—
Equity claims deducted from own funds in accordance with Articles 46 and 48 of the CRR.

PD ASSIGNED TO THE OBLIGOR GRADE (%)
Institutions applying the PD/LGD approach report in column 010 the probability of default (PD) calculated in accordance with the provisions referred to in Article 165(1) of CRR.
The PD assigned to the obligor grade or pool to be reported shall be in line with the minimum requirements as laid down in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, Section 6 of CRR. For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to that specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. All reported risk parameters shall be derived from the risk parameters used in the internal rating system approved by the respective competent authority.
For figures corresponding to an aggregation of obligor grades or pools (e.g. ‘total exposures’) the exposure weighted average of the PDs assigned to the obligor grades or pools included in the aggregation shall be provided. All exposures, including defaulted exposures are to be considered for the purpose of the calculation of the exposure weighted average PD. For the calculation of the exposure-weighted average PD, the exposure value taking into account unfunded credit protection (column 060) shall be used for weighting purposes.

ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE CONVERSION FACTORS
Institutions report in column 020 the original exposure value (pre conversion factors). According to the provisions laid down in Article 167 of CRR, the exposure value for equity exposures shall be the accounting value remaining after specific credit risk adjustments. The exposure value of off-balance sheet equity exposures shall be its nominal value after specific credit risk adjustments.
Institutions also include in column 020 off balance sheet items referred to in Annex I of CRR assigned to the equity exposure class (e.g. ‘the unpaid portion of partly-paid shares’).
Institutions applying the Simple Risk Weight approach or the PD/LGD approach (as referred to in Article 165(1) also consider the offsetting provisions referred to in Article 155(2) of CRR.

92.
This template requests information on both trading and non-trading book transactions which are unsettled after their due delivery dates, and their corresponding own funds requirements for settlement risk according to Articles 92(3) point (c) ii) and 378 of CRR.
93.
Institutions report in the CR SETT template information on the settlement/delivery risk in connection with debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities held in their trading or non-trading book.
94.
According to Article 378 of CRR, repurchase transactions, securities or commodities lending and securities or commodities borrowing in connection with debt instruments, equities, foreign currencies and commodities are not subject to settlement/delivery risk. Note however that, derivatives and long settlement transactions unsettled after their due delivery dates are nevertheless subject to own funds requirements for settlement/delivery risk as determined in Article 378 of CRR.
95.
In the case of unsettled transactions after the due delivery date, institutions calculate the price difference to which they are exposed. This is the difference between the agreed settlement price for the debt instrument, equity, foreign currency or commodity in question and its current market value, where the difference could involve a loss for the institution.
96.
Institutions multiply this difference by the appropriate factor of Table 1 of Article 378 of CRR to determine the corresponding own funds requirements.
97.
According to Article 92(4) Point (b), the own funds requirements for settlement/delivery risk shall be multiplied by 12.5 to calculate the risk exposure amount.
98.
Note that own funds requirements for free deliveries as laid down in Article 379 of CRR are not within the scope of the CR SETT template; the latter shall be reported in the credit risk templates (CR SA, CR IRB).

The risk weight for a securitisation position shall be the greater of 7 % or the risk weight to be applied in accordance with the formulas provided.
340
SUPERVSIORY FORMULA METHOD: AVERAGE RISK WEIGHT
Credit risk mitigation on securitisation positions may be recognised in accordance with Article 264 of CRR. In this case, the institution shall indicate the ‘effective risk weight’ of the position when full protection has been received, according to what is established in Article 264(2) of CRR (the effective risk weight equals the risk-weighted exposure amount of the position divided by the exposure value of the position, multiplied by 100).
When the position benefits from partial protection, the institution must apply the Supervisory Formula Method using the ‘T’ adjusted according to what is established in Article 264(3) of CRR.
Weighted average risk weights shall be reported in this column.
350
LOOK-THROUGH
The look-through columns comprise all the cases of unrated exposures where the risk weight is obtained from the underlying portfolio of exposures (highest risk weight of the pool).
Article 263(2) and (3) of CRR envisage an exceptional treatment where Kirb cannot be calculated.
The undrawn amount of the liquidity facilities shall be reported under ‘Off balance sheet items and derivatives’.
As long as an originator would be under the exceptional treatment where Kirb cannot be calculated, then column 350 would be the right column to use for the reporting of the risk weighting treatment given to the exposure value of a liquidity facility subject to the treatment laid down in Article 263 of CRR.
For early amortisations see Articles 256(5) and 265 of CRR.
360
LOOK-THROUGH: AVERAGE RISK WEIGHT
Exposure value weighted average risk weight shall be provided.
370
INTERNAL ASSESSMENT APPROACH
Article 259(3) and (4) of CRR envisages the ‘Internal Assessment Approach’ (IAA) for positions in ABCP programmes.
380
IAA: AVERAGE RISK WEIGHT
Weighted average risk weights shall be reported in this column.
390
(-) REDUCTION IN RISK WEIGHTED EXPOSURE AMOUNT DUE TO VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND PROVISIONS
Institutions applying the IRB Approach shall follow Article 266(1) (only applicable for originators, when the exposure has not been deducted from own funds) and (2) of CRR.
Value adjustments and provisions (Article 159 of CRR) for credit losses made in accordance with the accounting framework to which the reporting entity is subject. Value adjustments include any amount recognized in profit or loss for credit losses of financial assets since their initial recognition in the balance sheet (including losses due to credit risk of financial assets measured at fair value that shall not be deducted from the exposure value) plus the discounts on exposures purchased when in default according to Article 166(1) of CRR. Provisions include accumulated amounts of credit losses in off-balance sheet items.
400
RISK-WEIGHTED EXPOSURE AMOUNT
Total risk-weighted exposure amount calculated according to Part Three, Title II, Chapter 5, Section 3 of CRR prior to adjustments due to maturity mismatches or infringement of due diligence provisions, and excluding any risk weighted exposure amount corresponding to exposures redistributed via outflows to another template.
410
RWEA OF WHICH: SYNTHETIC SECURITISATIONS
For synthetic securitisations with maturity mismatches, the amount to be reported in this column shall ignore any maturity mismatch.
420
OVERALL EFFECT (ADJUSTMENT) DUE TO INFRINGEMENT OF THE DUE DILIGENCE PROVISIONS
Articles 14(2), 406(2) and 407 of CRR foresee that whenever certain requirements are not met by the institution, Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities impose a proportionate additional risk weight of no less than 250 % of the risk weight (capped at 1 250  %) which would apply to the relevant securitisation positions under Part Three, Title II, Chapter 5, Section 3 of CRR.
430
ADJUSTMENT TO THE RISK-WEIGHTED EXPOSURE AMOUNT DUE TO MATURITY MISMATCHES
For maturity mismatches in synthetic securitisations RW*-RW(SP), as defined in Article 250 of CRR, shall be included, except in the case of tranches subject to a risk weighting of 1 250  % where the amount to be reported is zero. Note that RW(SP) not only includes the risk weighted exposure amounts reported under column 400 but also the risk weighted exposure amounts corresponding to exposures redistributed via outflows to other templates.
Negative values shall be reported in this column.
440-450
TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED EXPOSURE AMOUNT: BEFORE CAP/AFTER CAP
Total risk-weighted exposure amount calculated according to Part Three, Title II, Chapter 5, Section 3 of CRR, before (col 440)/after (col 450) applying the limits specified in Article 260 of CRR. Additionally Article 265 of CRR (additional own funds requirements for securitisations of revolving exposures with early amortisation provisions) has to be considered.
460
MEMORANDUM ITEM: RISK WEIGHTED EXPOSURE AMOUNT CORRESPONDING TO THE OUTFLOWS FROM THE IRB SECURITISATION TO OTHER EXPOSURE CLASSES
Risk weighted exposure amount stemming from exposures redistributed to the risk mitigant provider, and therefore computed in the corresponding template, that are considered in the computation of the cap for securitisation positions.
106.
The CR SEC IRB template is divided into three major blocks of rows which gather data on the originated/sponsored/retained or purchased exposures by originators, investors and sponsors. For each of them, the information is broken down by on-balance sheet items and off-balance sheet items and derivatives, as well as by risk weight groupings of securitisations and re-securitisations.
107.
Total exposures (at reporting date) are also broken down according to the credit quality steps applied at inception (last block of rows). Originators, sponsors as well as investors shall report this information.
Rows
010
TOTAL EXPOSURES
Total exposures refer to the total amount of outstanding securitisations. This row summarizes all the information reported by originators, sponsors and investors in subsequent rows.
020
OF WHICH: RE-SECURITISATIONS
Total amount of outstanding re-securitisations according to definitions in Article 4(1)(63) and (64) of CRR.
030
ORIGINATOR: TOTAL EXPOSURES
This row summarizes information on on-balance items and off-balance sheet items and derivatives and early amortisation of those securitisation positions for which the institution plays the role of originator, as defined by Article 4(1)(13) of CRR.
040-090
ON-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS
Article 246(1) lit b) of CRR states that for those institutions which calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts under the IRB Approach, the exposure value of an on-balance sheet securitisation position shall be the accounting value without taking into account any credit risk adjustments made.
On-balance sheet items are broken down according to risk weight groupings of securitisations (A-B-C), in rows 050-070, and re-securitisations (D-E), in rows 080-090, as stated in Article 261(1) Table 4 of CRR.
100-150
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS AND DERIVATIVES
These rows gather information on off-balance sheet items and derivatives securitisation positions subject to a conversion factor under the securitisation framework. The exposure value of an off-balance sheet securitisation position shall be its nominal value, less any specific credit risk adjustment of that securitisation position, multiplied by a 100 % conversion factor unless otherwise specified.
Off-balance sheet securitisation positions arising from a derivative instrument listed in Annex II of CRR, shall be determined in accordance to Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6 of CRR. The exposure value for the counterparty credit risk of a derivative instrument listed in Annex II of CRR, shall be determined in accordance to Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6 of CRR.
For liquidity facilities, credit facilities and servicer cash advances, institutions shall provide the undrawn amount.
For interest rate and currency swaps they shall provide the exposure value (according to Article 246(1) of CRR) as specified in the CR SA Total template.
Off-balance sheet items are broken down according to risk weight groupings of securitisations (A-B-C), in rows 110-130, and re-securitisations (D-E), in rows 140-150, as stated in Article 261(1) Table 4 of CRR.

170
INVESTOR: TOTAL EXPOSURES
This row summarizes information on on-balance and off-balance sheet items and derivatives of those securitisation positions for which the institution plays the role of investor.
The CRR does not provide an explicit definition for investor. Therefore, in this context it shall be understood as an institution that holds a securitisation position in a securitisation transaction for which it is neither originator nor sponsor.
180-230
ON-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS
The same criteria of classification among securitisations (A-B-C) and re-securitisations (D-E) used for on-balance sheet items for originators shall be applied here.
240-290
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS AND DERIVATIVES
The same criteria of classification among securitisations (A-B-C) and re-securitisations (D-E) used for off-balance sheet items and derivatives for originators shall be applied here.
300
SPONSOR: TOTAL EXPOSURES
This row summarizes information on on-balance and off-balance sheet items and derivatives of those securitisation positions for which the institution plays the role of a sponsor, as defined by Article 4(1)(14) of CRR. If a sponsor is also securitising it own assets, it shall fill in the originator’s rows with the information regarding its own securitised assets.
310-360
ON-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS
The same criteria of classification among securitisations (A-B-C) and re-securitisations (D-E) used for on-balance sheet items and derivatives for originators shall be applied here.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS AND DERIVATIVES
The same criteria of classification among securitisations (A-B-C) and re-securitisations (D-E) used for off-balance sheet items and derivatives for originators shall be applied here.
430-540
BREAKDOWN OF OUTSTANDING POSITIONS ACCORDING TO CQS AT INCEPTION
These rows gather information on outstanding positions (at reporting date) according to credit quality steps (envisaged for the IRB in Article 261 Table 4 of CRR) applied at origination date (inception). In the absence of this information, the earliest CQS-equivalent data available shall be reported.
These rows are only to be reported for columns 170 to 320 and columns 400 to 410.
3.9.   C 14.00 – DETAILED INFORMATION ON SECURITISATIONS (SEC DETAILS)
3.9.1.   General remarks
108.
This template gathers information on a transaction basis (versus the aggregate information reported in CR SEC SA, CR SEC IRB, MKR SA SEC and MKR SA CTP templates) on all securitisations the reporting institution is involved. The main features of each securitisation, such as the nature of the underlying pool and the own funds requirements are requested.
109.
This template is to be reported for:
a.
Securitisations originated/sponsored by the reporting institution in case it holds at least one position in the securitisation. This means that, regardless of whether there has been a significant risk transfer or not, institutions shall report information on all the positions they hold (either in the banking book or trading book). Positions held include those positions retained due to Article 405 of CRR.
b.
Securitisations originated/sponsored by the reporting institution during the year of report (1), in case it holds no position.
c.
Securitisations, the ultimate underlying of which are financial liabilities originally issued by the reporting institution and (partially) acquired by a securitisation vehicle. This underlying could include covered bonds or other liabilities and shall be identified as such in column 160.
d.
Positions held in securitisations where the reporting institution is neither originator nor sponsor (i.e. investors and original lenders).
110.
This template shall be reported by consolidated groups and stand alone institutions (2) located in the same country where they are subject to own funds requirements. In case of securitisations involving more than one entity of the same consolidated group, the entity-by-entity detail breakdown shall be provided.
111.
On account of Article 406(1) of CRR, which establishes that institutions investing in securitisation positions shall acquire a great deal of information on them in order to comply with due diligence requirements the reporting scope of the template is applied to a limited extent to investors. In particular, they shall report columns 010-040; 070-110; 160; 190; 290-400; 420-470.
112.
Institutions playing the role of original lenders (not performing also the role of originators or sponsors in the same securitisation) shall generally report the template to the same extent as investors.
3.9.2.   Instructions concerning specific positions
Columns
005
ROW NUMBER
The row number is a row identifier and shall be unique for each row in the table. It shall follow the numerical order 1, 2, 3, etc.
010
INTERNAL CODE
Internal (alpha-numerical) code used by the institution to identify the securitisation. The internal code shall be associated to the identifier of the securitisation.
020
IDENTIFIER OF THE SECURITISATION (Code/Name)
Code used for the legal registration of the securitisation or, if not available, the name by which the securitisation is known in the market. When the International Securities Identification Number -ISIN- is available (i.e. for public transactions) the characters that are common to all tranches of the securitisation shall be reported in this column.
030
IDENTIFIER OF THE ORIGINATOR (Code/Name)
The code given by the supervisory authority to the originator or, if not available, the name of the institution itself shall be reported for this column.
In the case of multi-seller securitisations the reporting entity shall provide the identifier of all the entities within its consolidated group that are involved (as originator, sponsor or original lender) in the transaction. Whenever the code is not available or is not known by the reporting entity, the name of the institution shall be reported.
040
SECURITISATION TYPE: (TRADITIONAL/SYNTHETIC)
Report the following abbreviations:
—
‘T’ for Traditional;
—
‘S’ for Synthetic.
The definitions of ‘traditional securitisation’ and ‘synthetic securitisation’ is provided in Article 242(10) and (11) of CRR.
050
ACCOUNTING TREATMENT: SECURITISED EXPOSURES ARE KEPT OR REMOVED FROM THE BALANCE SHEET?
Originators, sponsors and original lenders shall report one of the following abbreviations:
—
‘K’ if entirely recognised
—
‘P’ if partially derecognised
—
‘R’ if entirely derecognised
—
‘N’ if not applicable.
This column summarises the accounting treatment of the transaction.
In case of synthetic securitisations, originators shall report that securitised exposures are removed from the balance sheet.
In case of the securitisations of liabilities originators shall not report this column.
Option ‘P’ (partially removed) shall be reported when the securitised assets are recognized in the balance sheet to the extent of the reporting entity’ continuing involvement as regulated in IAS 39.30-35.
060
SOLVENCY TREATMENT: SECURITISATION POSITIONS SUBJECT TO OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS?
Originators, only, shall report the following abbreviations:
—
‘N’ not subject to own funds requirements;
—
‘B’ banking book;
—
‘T’ trading book;
—
‘A’ partly in both books.
Articles 109, 243 and 244 of CRR.
This column summarises the solvency treatment of the securitisation scheme by the originator. It indicates whether own funds requirements are computed according to securitised exposures or securitisation positions (banking book/trading book).
If own funds requirements are based on securitised exposures (for not being significant risk transfer) the computation of own funds requirements for credit risk shall be reported in the CR SA template, in case the Standardised Approach is used, or in the CR IRB template, in case the Internal Ratings Based Approach is used by the institution.
Conversely, if own funds requirements are based on securitisation positions held in the banking book (for being significant risk transfer) the computation of own funds requirements for credit risk shall be reported in the CR SEC SA template or in the CR SEC IRB template. In the case of securitisation positions held in the trading book the computation of own funds requirements for market risk shall be reported in the MKR SA TDI (standardised general position risk) and in the MKR SA SEC or MKR SA CTP (standardised specific position risk) or in the MKR IM (internal models) templates.
In the case of the securitisations of liabilities originators shall not report this column.

—
‘S’ for securitisation;
—
‘R’ for re-securitisation.
080-100
RETENTION
Articles 404 to 410 of CRR.
080
TYPE OF RETENTION APPLIED
For each securitisation scheme originated, it shall be reported the relevant type of retention of net economic interest, as envisaged in Article 405 of CRR:
A
—
Vertical slice (securitisation positions): ‘retention of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of each of the tranches sold or transferred to the investors’.
V
—
Vertical slice (securitised exposures): retention of no less than 5 % of the credit risk of each of the securitised exposures, if the credit risk thus retained with respect to such securitised exposures always ranks pari passu with, or is subordinated to, the credit risk that has been securitised with respect to those same exposures.
B
—
Revolving exposures:‘in the case of securitisations of revolving exposures, retention of the originator’s interest of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures’.
C
—
On-balance sheet: ‘retention of randomly selected exposures, equivalent to no less than 5 % of the nominal amount of the securitised exposures, where such exposures would otherwise have been securitised in the securitisation, provided that the number of potentially securitised exposures is no less than 100 at origination’.
D
—
First loss: ‘retention of the first loss tranche and, if necessary, other tranches having the same or a more severe risk profile than those transferred or sold to investors and not maturing any earlier than those transferred or sold to investors, so that the retention equals in total no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures’.
E
—
Exempted. This code shall be reported for those securitisations affected by provisions in Article 405(3) of CRR.
N
—
Not applicable. This code shall be reported for those securitisations affected by provisions in Article 404 of CRR.
U
—
In breach or unknown. This code shall be reported when the reporting does not know with certain which type of retention is being applied or in case of non-compliance.
090
% OF RETENTION AT REPORTING DATE
The retention of material net economic interest by the originator, sponsor or original lender of the securitisation shall be no less than 5 % (at origination date).
Notwithstanding Article 405(1) of CRR, measurement of retention at origination can typically be interpreted as being when the exposures were first securitised, and not when the exposures were first created (for instance, not when the underlying loans were first extended). Measurement of retention at origination means that 5 % is the retention percentage that is required at the point in time when such retention level was measured and the requirement fulfilled (for instance, when the exposures were first securitised); dynamic re-measurement and readjustment of the retained percentage throughout the life of the transaction is not required.
This column shall not be reported in case codes ‘E’ (exempted) or ‘N’ (not applicable) are reported under column 080 (Type of retention applied).
100
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RETENTION REQUIREMENT?
Article 405(1) of CRR.
Report the following abbreviations:
Y
—
Yes;
N
—
No.
This column shall not be reported in case codes ‘E’ (exempted) or ‘N’ (not applicable) are reported under column 080 (Type of retention applied).
110
ROLE OF THE INSTITUTION: (ORIGINATOR/SPONSOR/ORIGINAL LENDER/INVESTOR)
Report the following abbreviations:
—
‘O’ for Originator;
—
‘S’ for Sponsor;
—
‘L’ for Original Lender;
—
‘I’ for Investor.
See definitions in Article 4(1)(13) (Originator) and Article 4(1)(14) (Sponsor) of CRR. Investors are assumed to be those institutions to which provisions in Articles 406 and 407of CRR apply.
120-130
NON ABCP PROGRAMS
Because of their special character because they comprise of several single securitisation positions, ABCP programs (defined in Article 242(9) of CRR) are exempted from reporting in columns 120 and 130.
120
ORIGINATION DATE (mm/yyyy)
The month and year of the origination date (i.e. cut-off or closing date of the pool) of the securitisation shall be reported according to the following format: ‘mm/yyyy’.
For each securitisation scheme the origination date cannot change between reporting dates. In the particular case of securitisation schemes backed by open pools, the origination date shall be the date of the first issuance of securities.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
130
TOTAL AMOUNT OF SECURITISED EXPOSURES AT ORIGINATION DATE
This column gathers the amount (according to original exposures pre conversion factors) of the securitised portfolio at the origination date.
In case of securitisation schemes backed by open pools the amount referring to the origination date of the first issuance of securities shall be reported. In the case of traditional securitisations no other assets of the securitisation pool shall be included. In the case of multi-seller securitisation schemes (i.e. with more than one originator) only the amount corresponding to the reporting entity’s contribution in the securitised portfolio shall be reported. In the case of the securitisation of liabilities only the amounts issued by the reporting entity shall be reported.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
140-220
SECURITISED EXPOSURES
Columns 140 to 220 request information on several features of the securitised portfolio by the reporting entity.
140
TOTAL AMOUNT
Institutions shall report the value of the securitised portfolio at reporting date, i.e. the outstanding amount of the securitised exposures. In the case of traditional securitisations no other assets of the securitisation pool shall be included. In the case of multi-seller securitisation schemes (i.e. with more than one originator) only the amount corresponding to the reporting entity’s contribution in the securitised portfolio shall be reported. In the case of securitisation schemes backed by closed pools (i.e. the portfolio of securitised assets cannot be enlarged after the origination date) the amount will progressively be reduced.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
150
INSTITUTION’S SHARE (%)
It shall be reported the institution’s share (percentage with two decimals) at reporting date in the securitised portfolio. The figure to be reported in this column is, by default, 100 % except for multi-seller securitisation schemes. In that case the reporting entity shall report its current contribution to the securitised portfolio (equivalent to column 140 in relative terms).
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
160
TYPE
This column gathers information on the type of assets (‘1’ to ‘8’) or liabilities (‘9’ and ‘10’) of the securitised portfolio. The institution must report one of the following number codes:
1

Residential mortgages;
2
—
Commercial mortgages;
3
—
Credit card receivables;
4
—
Leasing;
5

Other liabilities.
In case the pool of securitised exposures is a mix of the previous types, the institution shall indicate the most important type. In case of re-securitisations, the institution shall refer to the ultimate underlying pool of assets. Type ‘10’ (Other liabilities) includes treasury bonds and credit linked notes.
For securitisation schemes backed by closed pools the type cannot change between reporting dates.
170
APPROACH APPLIED (SA/IRB/MIX)
This column gathers information on the approach that at reporting date the institution would apply to the securitised exposures.
Report the following abbreviations:
—
‘S’
for Standardised Approach;
—
‘I’
for Internal Ratings Based Approach;
—
‘M’
for a combination of both approaches (SA/IRB).
If under SA, ‘P’ is reported in column 050 then the computation of own funds requirements shall be reported in the CR SEC SA template.
If under IRB, ‘P’ is reported in column 050 then the computation of own funds requirements shall be reported in the CR SEC IRB template.
If under combination of SA and IRB, ‘P’ is reported in column 050 then the computation of own funds requirements shall be reported in both the CR SEC SA and CR SEC IRB templates.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation. Nevertheless, this column does not apply to securitisations of liabilities. Sponsors shall not report this column.
180
NUMBER OF EXPOSURES
Article 261(1) of CRR.
This column is only compulsory for those institutions using the IRB approach to the securitisation positions (and, therefore, reporting ‘I’ in column 170). The institution shall report the effective number of exposures.
This column shall not be reported in case of securitisation of liabilities or when the own funds requirements are based on the securitised exposures (in case of securitisation of assets). This column shall not be fulfilled when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation. This column shall not be fulfilled by investors.
190
COUNTRY
Report the code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) of the country of origin of the ultimate underlying of the transaction, i.e. the country of the immediate obligor of the original securitised exposures (look through). In case the pool of the securitisation consists of different countries, the institution shall indicate the most important country. If no country exceeds a 20 % threshold based on the amount of assets/liabilities, then ‘OT’ (other) shall be reported.
200
ELGD (%)
The exposure-weighted average loss-given-default (ELGD) shall only be reported by those institutions applying the Supervisory Formula Method (and, therefore, reporting ‘I’ in column 170). The ELGD is to be calculated as indicated in Article 262(1) of CRR.
This column shall not be reported in case of securitisation of liabilities or when the own funds requirements are based on the securitised exposures (in case of securitisation of assets). This column shall not be fulfilled either when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation. Sponsors shall not report this column.
210
(-) VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND PROVISIONS
Value adjustments and provisions (Article 159 of CRR) for credit losses made in accordance with the accounting framework to which the reporting entity is subject. Value adjustments include any amount recognized in profit or loss for credit losses of financial assets since their initial recognition in the balance sheet (including losses due to credit risk of financial assets measured at fair value that shall not be deducted from the exposure value) plus the discounts on exposures purchased when in default according to Article 166(1) of CRR. Provisions include accumulated amounts of credit losses in off-balance sheet items.
This column gathers information on the value adjustments and provisions applied to the securitised exposures. This column shall not be reported in case of securitisation of liabilities.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
Sponsors shall not report this column.
220
OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS BEFORE SECURITISATION (%)
This column gathers information on the own funds requirements of the securitised portfolio in case there had been no securitisation plus the expected losses related to those risks (Kirb), as a percentage (with two decimals) on the total of securitised exposures at origination date. Kirb is defined in Article 242(4) of CRR.
This column shall not be reported in case of securitisation of liabilities. In case of the securitisation of assets, this piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
Sponsors shall not report this column.
230-300

(i)
the date when a clean-up call (defined in Article 242(2) of CRR) might first be exercised taking into account the maturity of the underlying exposure(s) as well as their expected pre-payment rate or potential re-negotiation activities;
(ii)
the date on which the originator may first exercise any other call option embedded in the contractual clauses of the securitisation which would result in the total redemption of the securitisation.
The day, month and year of the first foreseeable termination date shall be reported. The exact day shall be reported if this data is available, otherwise the first day of the month shall be reported.
300
LEGAL FINAL MATURITY DATE

MEMORANDUM ITEMS: OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS AND DERIVATIVES
This block of columns gathers additional information on the total off-balance sheet items and derivatives (which are already reported under a different breakdown in columns 340-360).
370
DIRECT CREDIT SUBSTITUTES (DCS)
This column applies to those securitisation positions held by the originator and guaranteed with direct credit substitutes (DCS).
According to Annex I of CRR the following full risk off-balance sheet items are regarded as DCS:
—
Guarantees having the character of credit substitutes.
—
Irrevocable standby letters of credit having the character of credit substitutes.

EARLY AMORTISATION: CONVERSION FACTOR APPLIED
Articles 242(12) and 256(5) (SA) and Article 265(1) (IRB) of CRR envisage a set of conversion factors to be applied to amount of the investors’ interest (in order to calculate risk-weighted exposure amounts).
This column applies to securitisation schemes with early amortisation clauses (i.e. revolving securitisations).
According to Article 256(6) of CRR, the conversion figure to be applied shall be determined by the level of the actual three month average excess spread.
In the case of the securitisations of liabilities this column shall not be reported. This piece of information is related to row 100 in CR SEC SA and row 160 in the CR SEC IRB template.

4.   OPERATIONAL RISK TEMPLATES
4.1.   C 16.00 – OPERATIONAL RISK (OPR)
4.1.1.   General Remarks
113.
This template provides information on the calculation of own funds requirements according to Articles 312 to 324 of CRR for Operational Risk under the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA), the Standardised Approach (TSA), the Alternative Standardised Approach (ASA) and the Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA). An institution cannot apply TSA and ASA for the business lines retail banking and commercial banking at the same time at solo level
114.
Institutions using the BIA, TSA and/or ASA shall calculate their own funds requirement, based on the information at financial year end. When audited figures are not available, institutions may use business estimates. If audited figures are used, institutions shall report the audited figures which should remain unchanged. Deviations from this ‘unchanged’ principle are possible, for instance if during that period the exceptional circumstances, such as recent acquisitions or disposals of entities or activities, are met.
115.
If an institution can justify its competent authority that – due to exceptional circumstances such as a merger or a disposal of entities or activities – using a three year average to calculating the relevant indicator would lead to a biased estimation for the own funds requirement for operational risk„ the competent authority may permit the institution to modify the calculation in a way that would take into account such events. Also the competent authority may on its own initiative, require an institution to modify the calculation. Where an institution has been in operation for less than three years it may use forward looking business estimates in calculating the relevant indicator, provided that it starts using historical data as soon as they are available.
116.
By columns, this template presents information, for the three most recent years, on the amount of the relevant indicator of the banking activities subject to operational risk and on the amount of loans and advances (the latter only applicable in the case of ASA). Next, information on the amount of own funds requirement for operational risk is reported. If applicable, it must be detailed which part of this amount is due to an allocation mechanism. Regarding AMA, memorandum items are added to present a detail of the effect of the expected loss, diversification and mitigation techniques on own funds requirement for operational risk.
117.
By rows, information is presented by method of calculation of the operational risk own funds requirement detailing business lines for TSA and ASA.
118.
This template shall be submitted by all institutions subject to operational risk own funds requirement.
4.1.2.   Instructions concerning specific positions
Columns
010 – 030
RELEVANT INDICATOR
Institutions using the relevant indicator to calculate the own funds requirement for operational risk (BIA, TSA and ASA) report relevant indicator for the respective years in columns 010 to 030. Moreover, in the case of a combined use of different approaches as referred in Article 314 of CRR, institutions also report, for information purposes, relevant indicator for the activities subject to AMA. It is also the case for all other AMA banks.
Hereafter, the term ‘relevant indicator’ refers to ‘the sum of the elements’ at the end of the financial year as defined in Article 316 point 1, Table1 of CRR.
If the institution has less than 3 years of data on ‘relevant indicator’ available, the available historical data (audited figures) shall be assigned by priority to the corresponding columns in the table. If, for instance, historical data for only one year is available, it shall be reported in column 030. If it seems reasonable, the forward looking estimates shall then be included in column 020 (estimate of next year) and column 010 (estimate of year +2).
Furthermore if there are no historical data on ‘relevant indicator’ available the institution may use forward-looking business estimates.
040 - 060
LOANS AND ADVANCES (IN THE CASE OF ASA APPLICATION)
These columns shall be used to report the amounts of the loans and advances for business lines ‘Commercial banking’ and ‘Retail banking’, as referred to in Article 319(1) point (b) of CRR. These amounts shall be used to calculate the alternative relevant indicator that leads to the own funds requirements corresponding to the activities subject to ASA (Article 319(1) point (a) of CRR).
For the ‘commercial banking’ business line, securities held in the non-trading book shall also be included.
070
OWN FUND REQUIREMENT
The own fund requirement is calculated according to the approach used, following Articles 312 to 324 of CRR The resulting amount is reported in column 070.
071
TOTAL OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE AMOUNT
Article 92(4) of CRR. Own funds requirements in column 070 multiplied by 12.5.
080
OF WHICH: DUE TO AN ALLOCATION MECHANISM
Article 18(1) of CRR (related to the inclusion, in the application referred to in Article 312(2) of CRR) of the methodology used for allocating operational risk capital between the different entities of the group and of whether and how diversification effects are intended to be factored in the risk measurement system used by a EU parent credit institution and its subsidiaries or jointly by the subsidiaries of an EU parent financial holding company or EU parent mixed financial holding company.
090 - 120
AMA MEMORANDUM ITEMS TO BE REPORTED IF APPLICABLE
090
OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENT BEFORE ALLEVIATION DUE TO EXPECTED LOSS, DIVERSIFICATION AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES
The own funds requirement reported in column 090 is the one of column 070 but calculated before taking into account the alleviation effects due to expected loss, diversification and risk mitigation techniques (see below).
100
(-) ALLEVIATION OF OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS DUE TO THE EXPECTED LOSS CAPTURED IN BUSINESS PRACTICES
In column 100 the alleviation of own funds requirements due to expected loss captured in internal business practices (as referred to in Article 322(2) point (a) of CRR) is reported.
110
(-) ALLEVIATION OF OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS DUE TO DIVERSIFICATION
The diversification effect in column 110 is the difference between the sum of own funds requirements calculated separately for each operational risk class (i.e. a ‘perfect dependence’ situation) and the diversified own funds requirement calculated by taking into account correlations and dependencies (i.e. assuming less than ‘perfect dependence’ between the risk classes). The ‘perfect dependence’ situation occurs in the ‘default case’, that is when the institution does not use explicit correlations structure between the risk classes, hence the AMA capital is computed as the sum of the individual operational risk measures of the chosen risk classes. In this case the correlation between the risk classes is assumed of 100 % and the value in the column has to be set to zero. Conversely, when the institution computes an explicit correlations structure between risk classes, it has to include in this column the difference between the AMA capital as stemming from the ‘default case’ and that obtained after applying the correlations structure between the risk classes. The value reflects the ‘diversification capacity’ of the AMA model, that is the ability of the model to capture the not simultaneous occurrence of severe operational risk loss events. In the column 110 the amount by which the assumed correlation structure decreases the AMA capital relative to the assumption of 100 % correlation has to be reported.
120
(-) ALLEVIATION OF OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENT DUE TO RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES (INSURANCE AND OTHER RISK TRANSFER MECHANISMS)
In column 120 the impact of insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms according to Article 323(1) to (5) of CRR is reported.

4.2.   C 17.00 – OPERATIONAL RISK: LOSSES AND RECOVERIES BY BUSINESS LINES AND EVENT TYPES IN THE LAST YEAR (OPR DETAILS)
4.2.1.   General Remarks
119.
This template summarises the information on the gross losses and loss recoveries registered by an institution in the last year according to event types and business lines.
120.
‘Gross loss’ means a loss stemming from an operational risk event or event type — as referred to in Article 322(3)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 — before recoveries of any type, without prejudice to 122.
121.
‘Recovery’ means an independent occurrence related to the original operational risk loss that is separate in time, in which funds or inflows of economic benefits are received from first or third parties, such as insurers or other parties.
122.
‘Rapidly recovered loss events’ means operational risk events that lead to losses that are partly or fully recovered within five working days. In case of a rapidly recovered loss event, only the part of the loss that is not fully recovered (i.e. the loss net of the partial rapid recovery) shall be included into the gross loss definition. As a consequence, loss events that lead to losses that are fully recovered within five working days shall not be included into the gross loss definition, as well as into the OPR Details reporting at all.
123.
‘Date of accounting’ means the date when a loss or reserve/provision was first recognized in the Profit and Loss statement, against an operational risk loss. This date logically follows the ‘Date of occurrence’ (i.e. the date when the operational risk event happened or first began) and the ‘Date of discovery’ (i.e. the date on which the institution became aware of the operational risk event).
124.
The Number of events is the number of operational risk events accounted for the first time within the reporting period.
125.
The Total loss amount is the algebraic sum of the following elements:
i.
The gross loss amounts pertinent to operational risk events ‘accounted for the first time’ within the reporting period (e.g. direct charges, provisions, settlements);
ii.
the gross loss amounts pertinent to positive loss adjustments made within the reporting period (e.g. increase of provisions, linked loss events, additional settlements) of operational risk events ‘accounted for the first time’ in previous reporting periods; and
iii.
the gross loss amounts pertinent to negative loss adjustments made within the reporting period — due to decrease of provisions — of operational risk events ‘accounted for the first time’ in previous reporting periods.
126.
The Number of events shall conventionally include also the events accounted for the first time in previous reporting periods and not yet reported in previous supervisory reports. The Total loss amount shall conventionally include also the elements as of Paragraph 124 pertinent to previous reporting periods and not yet reported in previous supervisory reports.
127.
The Maximum single loss is the largest single amount among those included in 124.i or 124.ii above.
128.
The Sum of the five largest losses is the sum of the five largest amounts among those included in 124.i or 124.ii above.
129.
The Total loss recovery is the sum of all the recoveries accounted within the reporting period and pertinent to operational risk events accounted for the first time within the reporting period or in previous reporting periods.
130.
The figures reported in June of the respective year are interim figures, while the final figures are reported in December. Therefore the figures in June have a six-month reference period (i.e. from 1/1 to 30/6 of the calendar year) while the figures in December have a twelve-month reference period (i.e. from 1/1 to 31/12 of the calendar year).
131.
The information is presented by distributing the losses and recoveries above internal thresholds amongst business lines (as defined in Article 317 of CRR, Table 2 of CRR including the additional business line ‘Corporate items’ as referred to in Article 322(3) point (b) of CRR) and event types (as defined in Article 324 of CRR), being possible that the losses corresponding to one event are distributed amongst several business lines.
132.
Columns present the different event types and the totals for each business line, together with a memorandum item that shows the lowest internal threshold applied in the data collection of losses, revealing within each business line the lowest and the highest threshold if there is more than one threshold.
133.
Rows present the business lines, and within each business line, information on the number of events, the total loss amount, the maximum single loss, the sum of the five largest losses and the total loss recovery.
134.
For the total business lines, data on the number of events and the total loss amount are also requested for certain ranges based on preset thresholds, 10 000, 20 000, 100 000, and 1 000 000. The thresholds are set in Euro amounts and are included for comparability purposes of the reported losses among institutions; therefore they do not necessarily relate with the minimum loss thresholds used for the internal loss data collection, to be reported in another section of the template.
135.
Where the algebraic sum of the elements of the total loss amount, as indicated in paragraph 124 above, determines a negative value for some business lines/event types combinations, the value of 0 shall be reported in the pertinent cells.
136.
This template shall be reported by institutions using AMA or TSA/ASA for the calculation of their own funds requirements.
137.
In order to verify the conditions envisaged by Article 5 point (b) (2) (b), the institutions shall use the latest statistics as available in the Supervisory Disclosure webpage of the EBA to get ‘the sum of individual balance sheet totals of all institutions within the same Member State’.
138.
Institutions subject to Article 5(b)(2)(b) of this Regulation may only report the following information for the sum of all event types (column 080) of the OPR Details template:
(a)
number of events (row 910);
(b)
total loss amount (row 920);
(c)
maximum single loss (row 930);
(d)
sum of the five largest losses (row 940) and
(e)
total loss recovery (row 950).
4.2.2.   Instructions concerning specific positions
Columns
010 -070
EVENT TYPES
Institutions report the losses in the respective columns 010 to 070 according to the event types as defined in Article 324 of CRR.
Institutions that calculate their own funds requirement according to TSA or ASA can report the losses for which the event type is not identified in column 080.
080
TOTAL EVENT TYPES
In column 080, for each business line, institutions report the total ‘number of events’, the total of ‘total loss amount’ and the total of ‘total loss recovery’ as the simple aggregation of the number of loss events, the total gross loss amounts and the total loss recovery amounts reported in columns 010 to 070. The ‘maximum single loss’ in column 080 is the maximum of the ‘maximum single gross losses’ reported in columns 010 to 070. For the sum of the five largest losses, in column 080 the sum of the five largest losses within one business line is reported.
090 - 100
MEMORANDUM ITEM: THRESHOLD APPLIED IN DATA COLLECTION
Institutions report in the columns 090 and 100 the minimum loss thresholds they are using for the internal loss data collection in accordance with Article 322(3) point (c) of CRR, last sentence of CRR. If the institution applies only one threshold for in each business line, only the column 090 shall be filled in. In the case where there are different thresholds applied within the same regulatory business line, then the highest applicable threshold (column 100) shall be filled in as well.

Rows
010 - 850
BUSINESS LINES: CORPORATE FINANCE, TRADING AND SALES, RETAIL BROKERAGE, COMMERCIAL BANKING, RETAIL BANKING, PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT, AGENCY SERVICES, ASSET MANAGEMENT, CORPORATE ITEMS
For each business line as defined in Article 317(4) table 2 of CRR, including the additional business line ‘Corporate items’ as referred to in Article 322(3) point (b) of CRR, and for each event type, the institution shall report, according to the internal thresholds the following information: number of events, total loss amount, maximum single loss, sum of the five largest losses and total loss recovery. For a loss event that affects more than one business line the ‘total loss amount’ is distributed among all the affected business lines.
910 - 950
TOTAL BUSINESS LINES
For each event type (column 010 to 080), the following information (Article 322(3) points b), c) and e) of CRR on total business lines (rows 910 to 950) has to be reported:
—
Number of events (row 910): the number of events above the internal threshold by event types for the total business lines shall be reported. This figure may be lower than the aggregation of the number of events by business lines since the events with multiple impacts (impacts in different business lines) shall be considered as one.
—
Number of events. Of which, ≥ 10,000 and < 20,000, ≥ 20,000 and < 100,000, ≥ 100,000 and < 1 000 000 , ≥ 1 000 000  (rows 911 to 914): the number of internal events included in the ranges defined in the pertinent rows shall be reported.
—
Total loss amount (row 920): the total loss amount is the simple aggregation of the total loss amount for each business line.
—
Total loss amount, Of which, ≥ 10,000 and < 20,000, ≥ 20,000 and < 100,000, ≥ 100,000 and < 1 000 000 , ≥ 1 000 000  (rows 921 to 924): the total loss amount included in the ranges defined in the pertinent rows shall be reported.
—
Maximum single loss (row 930): the maximum single loss is the maximum loss over the internal threshold for each event type and amongst all business lines. These figures may be higher than the highest single loss recorded in each business line if an event impacts different business lines.
—
Sum of the five largest losses (row 940): the sum of the five largest gross losses for each event type and amongst all business lines is reported. This sum may be higher than the highest sum of the five largest losses recorded in each business line. This sum has to be reported regardless the number of losses.
—
Total loss recovery (row 950): the total loss recovery is the simple aggregation of the total loss recovery for each business line.
910-950/080
TOTAL BUSINESS LINES — TOTAL EVENT TYPES
—
Number of events: for each row from 910 to 914, the number of events is equal to the horizontal aggregation of the number of events in the corresponding row, given that in those figures the events with impacts in different business lines shall have already been considered as one event. The number in row 910 shall not necessarily be equal to the vertical aggregation of the number of events which are included in column 080, given that one event can have an impact in different business lines simultaneously.
—
Total loss amount: for each row from 920 to 924, the total loss amount is equal to both the horizontal aggregation of total loss amounts by event type in the corresponding row. The total loss amount in row 920 is equal to the vertical aggregation of total loss amounts by business line in column 080.
—
Maximum single loss: as previously mentioned, when an event has impact in different business lines, it may be that the amount for ‘Maximum single loss’ in ‘Total Business lines’ for that particular event type is higher than the amounts of ‘Maximum single loss’ in each business line. Hence, the amount in this cell shall be equal to the highest of the values of ‘Maximum single loss’ in ‘Total Business lines’, which may not necessarily be equal to the highest value of ‘Maximum single loss’ across business lines in column 080.
—
Sum of the five largest losses: it is the sum of the five largest losses in the whole matrix, which means that it may not necessarily be equal to neither the maximum value of ‘sum of the five largest losses’ in ‘Total Business lines’ nor the maximum value of ‘sum of the five largest losses’ in column 080.
—
Total loss recovery: it is equal to both the horizontal aggregation of total loss recoveries by event type in row 950 and the vertical aggregation of total loss recoveries by business line in column 080.
5.   MARKET RISK TEMPLATES
139.
These instructions refer to the templates reporting of the calculation of own funds requirements according to the standardised approach for foreign exchange risk (MKR SA FX), commodities risk (MKR SA COM) interest rate risk (MKR SA TDI, MKR SA SEC, MKR SA CTP) and equity risk (MKR SA EQU). Additionally, instructions for the template reporting of the calculation of own funds requirements according to the internal models approach (MKR IM) are included in this part.
140.
The position risk on a traded debt instrument or equity (or debt or equity derivative) shall be divided into two components in order to calculate the capital required against it. The first shall be its specific-risk component — this is the risk of a price change in the instrument concerned due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The second component shall cover its general risk — this is the risk of a price change in the instrument due (in the case of a traded debt instrument or debt derivative) to a change in the level of interest rates or (in the case of an equity or equity derivative) to a broad equity- market movement unrelated to any specific attributes of individual securities. The general treatment of specific instruments and netting procedures can be found in Articles 326 to 333 of CRR.
5.1.   C 18.00 – MARKET RISK: STANDARDISED APPROACH FOR POSITION RISKS IN TRADED DEBT INSTRUMENTS (MKR SA TDI)
5.1.1.   General Remarks
141.
This template captures the positions and the related own funds requirements for position risks on traded debt instruments under the standardised approach (Articles 102 and 105 (1) of CRR). The different risks and methods available under the CRR are considered by rows. The specific risk associated with exposures included in MKR SA SEC and MKR SA CTP only has to be reported in the Total template of the MKR SA TDI. The own funds requirements reported in those templates shall be transferred to cell {325;060} (securitisations) and {330;060} (CTP) respectively..

5.2.1.   General Remarks
143.
This template requests information on positions (all/net and long/short) and the related own funds requirements for the specific risk component of position risk in securitisations/re-securitisations held in the trading book (not eligible for correlation trading portfolio) under the standardised approach.
144.
The MKR SA SEC template determines the own funds requirement only for the specific risk of securitisation positions according to Articles 335 in connection with 337 CRR. If securitisation positions of the trading book are hedged by credit derivatives, Articles 346 and 347 CRR apply. There is only one template for all positions of the trading book, irrespective of the fact whether the institution uses the Standardised Approach or the Internal Ratings Based Approach to determine the risk weight for each of the positions according to Part Three Title II Chapter 5 of CRR. The reporting of the own funds requirements of the general risk of these positions is conducted in the MKR SA TDI or the MKR IM template.
145.
Positions which receive a risk weight of 1,250 % can alternatively be deducted from CET1 (see 243(1) point (b), 244(1) point (b) and 258 of CRR). If this is the case, those positions have to be reported in row 460 of CA1.

5.3.   C 20.00 — MARKET RISK: STANDARDISED APPROACH FOR SPECIFIC RISK FOR POSITIONS ASSIGNED TO THE CORRELATION TRADING PORTFOLIO (MKR SA CTP)
5.3.1.   General Remarks
146.
This template requests information on positions of the CTP (comprising securitisations, nth-to-default credit derivatives and other CTP positions included according to Article 338(3)) and the corresponding own funds requirements under the standardised approach.
147.
The MKR SA CTP template determines the own funds requirement only for the specific risk of positions assigned to the Correlation Trading Portfolio according to Articles 335 in connection with 338 (2) and (3) of CRR. If CTP- positions of the trading book are hedged by credit derivatives, Articles 346 and 347 CRR apply. There is only one template for all CTP-positions of the trading book, irrespective of the fact whether the institution uses the Standardised Approach or the Internal Ratings Based Approach to determine the risk weight for each of the positions according to Part Three Title II Chapter 5 of CRR. The reporting of the own funds requirements of the general risk of these positions is conducted in the MKR SA TDI or the MKR IM template.
148.
This structure of the template separates securitisation positions, n-th to default credit derivatives and other CTP-positions. As a result, securitisation positions shall always be reported in rows 030, 060 or 090 (depending on the role of the institution in the securitisation). N-th to default credit derivatives shall always be reported in line 110. The ‘other CTP-positions’ are neither securitisation positions nor n-th to default credit derivatives (see definition in Article 338(3) CRR), but they are explicitly ‘linked’ (because of the hedging intent) to one of these two positions. That is why they are assigned either under the sub-heading ‘securitisation’ or ‘n-th to default credit derivative’.
149.
Positions which receive a risk weight of 1,250 % can alternatively be deducted from CET1 (see 243(1) point (b), 244(1) point (b) and 258 of CRR). If this is the case, those positions have to be reported in row 460 of CA1.

5.7.1.   General Remarks
155.
This template provides a breakdown of VaR and stressed VaR (sVaR) figures according to the different market risks (debt, equity, FX, commodities) and other information relevant for the calculation of the own funds requirements.
156.
Generally the reporting depends on the structure of the model of the institutions whether they report the figures for general and specific risk separately or together. The same holds true for the decomposition of the VAR/Stress-Var into the risk categories (interest rate risk, equity risk, commodities risk and foreign exchange risk). An institution can resign to report the decompositions mentioned above if it proves that a reporting of these figures would be unduly burdensome.

For the purposes of Annexes III and IV, a data point shadowed in grey shall mean that this data point is not requested or that it is not possible to report it. In Annex IV, a row or a column with references shadowed in black means that the related data points should not be submitted by those institutions that follow those references in that row or column.
6.
Templates in Annexes III and IV include implicit validation rules which are laid down in the templates themselves through the use of conventions.
7.
The use of brackets in the label of an item in a template means that this item is to be subtracted to obtain a total, but it does not mean that it shall be reported as negative.
8.
Items that shall be reported in negative are identified in the compiling templates by including ‘(–)’ at the beginning of their label such as in ‘(–) Treasury shares’.
9.
In the ‘Data Point Model’ (‘DPM’) for financial information reporting templates of Annexes III and IV, every data point (cell) has a ‘base item’ to which the ‘credit/debit’ attribute is allocated. This allocation ensures that all entities who report data points follow the ‘sign convention’ and allows to know the ‘credit/debit’ attribute that corresponds to each data point.
10.
Schematically, this convention works as in Table 1.

36.
The counterparty sector allocation is based exclusively on the nature of the immediate counterparty. The classification of the exposures incurred jointly by more than one obligor shall be done on the basis of the characteristics of the obligor that was the more relevant, or determinant, for the institution to grant the exposure. Among other classifications, the distribution of jointly incurred exposures by counterparty sector, country of residence and NACE codes should be driven by the characteristics of the more relevant or determinant obligor.

Reporting of NACE codes shall be done with the first level of disaggregation (by ‘section’).
45.
For debt instruments at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, ‘Gross carrying amount’ shall mean the carrying amount excluding ‘Accumulated impairment’.

47.
Debt instruments that are past due but not impaired at the reporting reference date shall be reported in the accounting portfolios subject to impairment. According to IFRS or compatible National GAAP, these accounting portfolios comprise the categories ‘Available for sale’, ‘Loans and receivables’, and ‘Held-to-maturity’. According to National GAAP based on BAD, these accounting portfolios comprise also ‘Non-trading debt instruments measured at a cost-based method’ and ‘Other non-trading non-derivative financial assets’.
48.
Assets qualify as past due when counterparties have failed to make a payment when contractually due. The whole amounts of such assets shall be reported and broken down according to the number of days of the oldest past due instalment. The past due analysis shall not include any impaired assets. The carrying amount of impaired financial assets shall be reported separately from the past due assets.
49.
The column ‘Accumulated write-offs’ includes the cumulative amount of principal and past due interest of any debt instrument that the institution is no longer recognising because they are considered uncollectible, independently of the portfolio in which they were included. These amounts shall be reported until the total extinguishment of all the institution’s rights (by expiry of the statute-of–limitations period, forgiveness or other causes) or until recovery.
50.
‘Write-offs’ could be caused both by reductions of the carrying amount of financial assets recognised directly in profit or loss as well as by reductions in the amounts of the allowance accounts for credit losses taken against the carrying amount of financial assets.
8.   BREAKDOWN OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (8)
51.
As ‘Deposits’ are defined in the same way as in the ECB BSI Regulation, regulated savings deposits shall be classified in accordance with the ECB BSI Regulation and distributed according to the counterparty.

‘Covered Bonds’ according to Article 129(1) of CRR;
(d)
‘Hybrid contracts’ comprise contracts with embedded derivatives;
(e)
‘Other debt securities issued’ includes debt securities not recorded in the previous lines and distinguishes convertible and non-convertible instruments.
53.
‘Subordinated financial liabilities’ issued are treated in the same way as other financial liabilities incurred. Subordinated liabilities issued in the form of securities are classified as ‘Debt securities issued’, whereas subordinated liabilities in the form of deposits are classified as ‘Deposits’.
54.
Template 8.2 includes the carrying amount of ‘Deposits’ and ‘Debt securities issued’ that meet the definition of subordinated debt classified by accounting portfolios. ‘Subordinated debt’ instruments provide a subsidiary claim on the issuing institution that can only be exercised after all claims with a higher status have been satisfied [ECB BSI Regulation].
9.   LOAN COMMITMENTS, FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS (9)
55.
Off-balance sheet exposures include the off-balance sheet items listed in Annex I of CRR. Off-balance sheet exposures shall be broken down in loan commitments given, financial guarantees given, and other commitments given.
56.
Information on loan commitments, financial guarantees, and other commitments given and received include both revocable and irrevocable commitments.
57.
‘Loan commitments’ are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions, except those that are derivatives because they can be settled net in cash or by delivering or issuing another financial instrument. The following items of Annex I of CRR shall be classified as ‘Loan commitments’:
(a)
‘Forward deposits’.
(b)
‘Undrawn credit facilities’ which comprise agreements to ‘lend’ or provide ‘acceptance facilities’ under pre-specified terms and conditions.
58.
‘Financial guarantees’ are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of a loss it incurs, because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Under IFRS or compatible National GAAP, these contracts meet the IAS 39.9 and IFRS 4.A definition of financial guarantee contracts. The following items of Annex I of CRR shall be classified as ‘financial guarantees’:
(a)
‘Guarantees having the character of credit substitute’;
(b)
‘Credit derivatives’ that meet the definition of financial guarantee;
(c)
‘Irrevocable standby letters of credit having the character of credit substitutes’;
59.
‘Other commitments’ includes the following items of Annex I of CRR:
(a)
‘Unpaid portion of partly-paid shares and securities’;
(b)
‘Documentary credits issued or confirmed’;
(c)
Trade finance Off-balance sheet items;
(d)
‘Documentary credits in which underlying shipment acts as collateral and other self-liquidating transactions’;
(e)
‘Warranties and indemnities’ (including tender and performance bonds) and ‘guarantees not having the character of credit substitutes’;
(f)
‘Shipping guarantees, customs and tax bonds’;
(g)
Note issuance facilities (NIFs) and revolving underwritings facilities (RUFs);
(h)
‘Undrawn credit facilities’ which comprise agreements to ‘lend’ or provide ‘acceptance facilities’ when the terms and conditions are not pre-specified;
(i)
‘Undrawn credit facilities’ which comprise agreements to ‘purchase securities’ or ‘provide guarantees’;
(j)
‘Undrawn credit facilities for tender and performance guarantees’;
(k)
‘Other off-balance sheet items’ in Annex I of CRR.
60.
Under IFRS or compatible National GAAP, the following item are recognised in the balance sheet and, consequently, should not be reported as off-balance sheet exposures:
(a)
‘Credit derivatives’ that do not meet the definition of financial guarantees are ‘derivatives’ under IAS 39;
(b)
‘Acceptances’ are obligations by an institution to pay on maturity the face value of a bill of exchange, normally covering the sale of goods. Consequently, they are classified as ‘trade receivables’ on the balance sheet;
(c)
‘Endorsements on bills’ that do not meet the criteria for de-recognition under IAS 39;
(d)
‘Transactions with recourse’ that do not meet the criteria for de-recognition under IAS 39;
(e)
‘Assets purchased under outright forward purchase agreements’ are ‘derivatives’ under IAS 39;
(f)
‘Asset sale and repurchase agreements as defined in Article 12(3) and (5) of Directive 86/635/EEC’. In these contracts, the transferee has the option, but not the obligation, to return the assets at a price agreed in advance on a date specified (or to be specified). Therefore, these contracts meet the definition of derivatives under IAS 39.9.
61.
‘of which: defaulted’ shall include the nominal amount of those loan commitments, financial guarantees and other commitments given whose counterparty has incurred in default according to Article 178 of CRR.
62.
For off-balance sheet exposures, the ‘Nominal amount’ is the amount that best represents the institution’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements. In particular, for financial guarantees given, the nominal amount is the maximum amount the entity could have to pay if the guarantee is called on. For loan commitments, the nominal amount is the undrawn amount that the institution has committed to lend. Nominal amounts are exposure values before applying conversion factors and credit risk mitigation techniques.
63.
In template 9.2, for loan commitments received, the nominal amount is the total undrawn amount that the counterparty has committed to lend to the institution. For other commitments received the nominal amount is the total amount committed by the other party in the transaction. For financial guarantees received, the ‘maximum amount of the guarantee that can be considered’ is the maximum amount the counterparty could have to pay if the guarantee is called on. When a financial guarantee received has been issued by more than one guarantor, the guaranteed amount shall be reported only once in this template; the guaranteed amount shall be allocated to guarantor that is more relevant for the mitigation of credit risk.
10.   DERIVATIVES (10 AND 11)
64.
The carrying amount and the notional amount of the derivatives held for trading and the derivatives held for hedge accounting shall be reported broken down by type of underlying risk, type of market (over-the-counter versus organised markets) and type of product.
Under the relevant National GAAP based on BAD, all trading and hedging derivatives shall be reported in these templates irrespective of the portfolio or whether they are recognised on the balance sheet or not under the relevant National GAAP.
65.
Institutions shall report the derivatives held for hedge accounting broken down by type of hedge.
66.
Derivatives included in hybrid instruments which have been separated from the host contract shall be reported in templates 10 and 11 according to the nature of the derivative. The amount of the host contract is not included in these templates. However, if the hybrid instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss, the contract as a whole shall be included in the category of held for trading or financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss (and, thus, the embedded derivatives are not reported in 10 and 11).
10.1.   Classification of derivatives by type of risk
67.
All derivatives shall be classified into the following risk categories:
(a)
Interest rate: Interest rate derivatives are contracts related to an interest-bearing financial instrument whose cash flows are determined by referencing interest rates or another interest rate contract such as an option on a futures contract to purchase a Treasury bill. This category is restricted to those deals where all the legs are exposed to only one currency’s interest rate. Thus it excludes contracts involving the exchange of one or more foreign currencies such as cross-currency swaps and currency options, and other contracts whose predominant risk characteristic is foreign exchange risk, which are to be reported as foreign exchange contracts. Interest rate contracts include forward rate agreements, single-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate options (including caps, floors, collars and corridors), interest rate swaptions and interest rate warrants.
(b)
Equity: Equity derivatives are contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a particular equity or to an index of equity prices.
(c)
Foreign exchange and gold: These derivatives include contracts involving the exchange of currencies in the forward market and the exposure to gold. They therefore cover outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps (including cross-currency interest rate swaps), currency futures, currency options, currency swaptions and currency warrant. Foreign exchange derivatives include all deals involving exposure to more than one currency, whether in interest rates or exchange rates. Gold contracts include all deals involving exposure to that commodity.
(d)
Credit: Credit derivatives are contracts that do not meet the definition of financial guarantees and in which the payout is linked primarily to some measure of the creditworthiness of a particular reference credit. The contracts specify an exchange of payments in which at least one of the two legs is determined by the performance of the reference credit. Payouts can be triggered by a number of events, including a default, a rating downgrade or a stipulated change in the credit spread of the reference asset.
(e)
Commodity: These derivatives are contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of, or to a price index of, a commodity such as a precious metal (other than gold), petroleum, lumber or agricultural products.
(f)
Other: These derivatives are any other derivative contracts, which do not involve an exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity or credit risk such as climatic derivatives or insurance derivatives.
68.
When a derivative is influenced by more than one type of underlying risk, the instrument shall be allocated to the most sensitive type of risk. For multi-exposure derivatives, in cases of uncertainty, the deals shall be allocated according to the following order of precedence:
(a)
Commodities: All derivatives transactions involving a commodity or commodity index exposure, whether or not they involve a joint exposure in commodities and any other risk category which may include foreign exchange, interest rate or equity, shall be reported in this category.
(b)
Equities: With the exception of contracts with a joint exposure to commodities and equities, which are to be reported as commodities, all derivatives transactions with a link to the performance of equities or equity indices shall be reported in the equity category. Equity deals with exposure to foreign exchange or interest rates should be included in this category.
(c)
Foreign exchange and gold: This category includes all derivatives transactions (with the exception of those already reported in the commodity or equity categories) with exposure to more than one currency, be it pertaining either to interest-bearing financial instruments or exchange rates.
10.2.   Amounts to be reported for derivatives
69.
The ‘carrying amount’ for all derivatives (hedging or trading) is the fair value under IFRS. Derivatives with a positive fair value (above zero) are ‘financial assets’ and derivatives with a negative fair value (below zero) are ‘financial liabilities’. The ‘carrying amount’ shall be reported separately for derivatives with a positive fair value (‘financial assets’) and for those with a negative fair value (‘financial liabilities’). At the date of initial recognition, a derivative is classified as ‘financial asset’ or ‘financial liability’ according to its initial fair value. After initial recognition, as the fair value of a derivative increases or decreases, the terms of the exchange may become either favourable to the institution (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial asset’) or unfavourable (and the derivative is classified as ‘financial liability’).
Under the relevant National GAAP based on BAD, the reported carrying amount shall be the carrying amount including accruals, premium values and provisions if applicable under National GAAP. In addition to carrying amounts market values shall be reported by reporting institutions under National GAAP based on BAD.
70.
The ‘Notional amount’ is the gross nominal of all deals concluded and not yet settled at the reference date. In particular, the following shall be taken account to determine the notional amount:
(a)
For contracts with variable nominal or notional principal amounts, the basis for reporting is the nominal or notional principal amounts at the reference date;
(b)
The notional amount value to be reported for a derivative contract with a multiplier component is the contract effective notional amount or par value;
(c)
Swaps: The notional amount of a swap is the underlying principal amount upon which the exchange of interest, foreign exchange or other income or expense is based;
(d)
Equity and commodity-linked contracts: The notional amount to be reported for an equity or commodity contract is the quantity of the commodity or equity product contracted for purchase or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit. The notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts with multiple exchanges of principal is the contractual amount multiplied by the number of remaining exchanges of principal in the contract;
(e)
Credit derivatives: The contract amount to be reported for credit derivatives is the nominal value of the relevant reference credit;
(f)
Digital options have a predefined payoff which can be either a monetary amount or a number of contracts of an underlying. The notional amount for digital options is defined as either the predefined monetary amount or the fair value of the underlying at the reference date.
71.
The column ‘Notional amount’ of derivatives includes, for each line item, the sum of the notional amounts of all contracts in which the institution is counterparty, independently of whether the derivatives are considered assets or liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. All notional amounts shall be reported regardless whether the fair value of derivatives is positive, negative or equal to zero. Netting among the notional amounts is not allowed.
72.
The ‘Notional amount’ shall be reported by ‘total’ and by ‘of which: sold’ for the line items: ‘OTC options’, ‘Organised market options’, ‘Commodity’ and ‘Other’. The item ‘of which sold’ includes the notional amounts (strike price) of the contracts in which the counterparties (option holders) of the institution (option writer) have the right to exercise the option and for the items related to credit risk derivatives, the notional amounts of the contracts in which the institution (protection seller) has sold (gives) protection to their counterparties (protection buyers).
10.3.   Derivatives classified as ‘economic hedges’
73.
Derivatives that are not effective hedging instruments in accordance with IAS 39 or with the accounting framework under National GAAP based on BAD should be included in the ‘held for trading’ portfolio. This applies also to derivatives held for hedging purposes not meeting the requirements in IAS 39 or with the accounting framework under National GAAP based on BAD to be effective hedging instruments as well as to derivatives linked to unquoted equity instruments whose fair value cannot be measured reliably.
74.
Derivatives ‘held for trading’ that meet the definition of ‘economic hedges’ shall be reported separately for each type of risk. The item ‘economic hedges’ includes those derivatives that are classified as ‘held for trading’ but they are not part of the trading book as defined in Article 4(1)(86) of CRR. This item does not include derivatives for proprietary trading.
10.4.   Breakdown of derivatives by counterparty sector
75.
The carrying amount and the total notional amount of derivatives held for trading, and also of derivatives held for hedge accounting, which are traded in the OTC market, shall be reported by counterparty using the following categories:
(a)
‘credit institutions’,
(b)
‘other financial corporations’, and
(c)
‘rest’ comprising all other counterparties.
76.
All OTC derivatives, without regarding the type of risk to which they are related, shall be broken down by these counterparties. Counterparty breakdown for credit risk derivatives refers to the sector where the counterparty of the institution in the contract (buyer or seller of protection) is allocated.
11.   MOVEMENTS IN ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND IMPAIRMENT OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS (12)
77.
‘Increases due to amounts set aside for estimated loan losses during the period’ shall be reported when, for the main category of assets or the counterparty, the estimation of the impairment for the period result in the recognition of net expenses; that is, for the given category or counterparty, the increases in the impairment for the period exceed the decreases. ‘Decreases due to amounts reversed for estimated loan losses during the period’ shall be reported when, for the main category of assets or counterparty, the estimation of the impairment for the period result in the recognition of net income; that is, for the given category or counterparty, the decreases in the impairment for the period exceed the increases.
78.
As explained in paragraph 50 of this Part, ‘write-offs’ may be done either by recognising directly in the statement of profit or loss the reduction in the amount of the financial asset (without using an allowance account) or by reducing the amount of the allowance accounts related to a financial asset. ‘Decreases due to amounts taken against allowances’ means decreases in the accumulated amount of allowances due to ‘write-offs’ made during the period because the related debt instruments are considered uncollectible. ‘Value adjustments recorded directly to the statement of profit or loss’ are ‘write-offs’ made during the period directly against the amount of the related financial asset.
12.   COLLATERAL AND GUARANTEES RECEIVED (13)
12.1.   Breakdown of loans and advances by collateral and guarantees (13.1)
79.
The pledges and guarantees backing the loans and advances shall be reported by type of pledges: mortgage loans and other collateralised loans, and by financial guarantees. The loans and advances shall be broken down by counterparties.
80.
In template 13.1, the ‘maximum amount of the collateral or guarantee that can be considered’ shall be reported. The sum of the amounts of a financial guarantee and/or collateral shown in the related columns of template 13.1 shall not exceed the carrying amount of the related loan.
81.
For reporting loans and advances according to the type of pledge the following definitions shall be used:
(a)
within ‘Mortgage loans [Loans collateralised by immovable property]’, ‘Residential’ includes loans secured by residential immovable property and ‘Commercial’ loans secured by pledges of commercial immovable property; in both cases as defined in CRR;
(b)
within ‘Other collateralised loans’, ‘Cash [Debt instruments issued]’ shall include: (a) deposits in the reporting institution that have been pledged as collateral for a loan; (b) or debt securities issued by the reporting institution which have been pledged as collateral for a loan. ‘Rest’ includes pledges of other securities issued by any third party or pledges of other assets;
(c)
‘Financial guarantees received’ include contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the institution of a loss it incurs, because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
82.
For loans and advances that have simultaneously more than one type of collateral or guarantee, the amount of the ‘Maximum collateral/guarantee that can be considered’ shall be allocated according to its quality starting from the one with the best quality.
12.2.   Collateral obtained by taking possession during the period [held at the reporting date] (13.2)
83.
This template includes the carrying amount of the collateral that has been obtained between the beginning and the end of the reference period and that remain recognised in the balance sheet at the reference date.
12.3.   Collateral obtained by taking possession [tangible assets] accumulated (13.3)
84.
‘Foreclosure [tangible assets]’ is the cumulative carrying amount of tangible assets obtained by taking possession of collateral that remains recognised in the balance sheet at the reference date excluding those classified as ‘Property, plant and equipment’.
13.   FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE (14)
85.
Institutions shall report the value of financial instruments measured at fair value according to the hierarchy provided by in IFRS 13.72.
86.
‘Change in fair value for the period’ shall include gains or losses from re-measurements in the period of the instruments that continue to exist at the reporting date. These gains and losses are reported as for inclusion in the statement of profit or loss; thus, the amounts reported are before taxes.
87.
‘Accumulated change in fair value before taxes’ shall include the amount of gains or losses from re-measurements of the instruments accumulated from the initial recognition to the reference date.
14.   DERECOGNITION AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL ASSETS (15)
88.
Template 15 includes information on transferred financial assets of which part or all do not qualify for de-recognition, and financial assets entirely derecognised for which the institution retains servicing rights.
89.
The associated liabilities shall be reported according to the portfolio in which the related transferred financial assets were included in the assets side and not according to the portfolio in which they were included in the liability side.
90.
The column ‘Amounts derecognised for capital purposes’ includes the carrying amount of the financial assets recognised for accounting purposes but derecognised for prudential purposes because the institution is treating them as securitisation positions for capital purposes in accordance with Article 109 of CRR since significant credit risk has been transferred according to the articles 243 and 244 of CRR.
91.
‘Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’) are transactions in which the institution receives cash in exchange for financial assets sold at a given price under a commitment to repurchase the same (or identical) assets at a fixed price on a specified future date. Transactions involving the temporary transfer of gold against cash collateral shall also be considered ‘Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’). Amounts received by the institution in exchange for financial assets transferred to a third party (‘temporary acquirer’) shall be classified under ‘repurchase agreements’ where there is a commitment to reverse the operation and not merely an option to do so. Repurchase agreements also include repo-type operations which may include:
(a)
Amounts received in exchange for securities temporarily transferred to a third party in the form of securities lending against cash collateral;
(b)
Amounts received in exchange for securities temporarily transferred to a third party in the form of sale/buy-back agreement.
92.
‘Repurchase agreements’ (‘repos’) and ‘reverse repurchase loans’ (‘reverse repos’) involve cash received or loaned out by the institution.
93.
In a securitisation transaction, when the transferred financial assets are derecognized, institutions shall declare the gains (losses) generated by the item within the income statement corresponding to the ‘accounting portfolios’ in which the financial assets were included prior to their de-recognition.
15.   BREAKDOWN OF SELECTED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS ITEMS (16)
94.
For selected items of the income statement further breakdowns of gains (or income) and losses (or expenses) shall be reported.
15.1.   Interest income and expenses by instrument and counterparty sector (16.1)
95.
The interests shall be broken down both by interest income on financial and other assets as well as on financial liabilities with negative effective interest rate, and interest expenses on financial and other liabilities as well as on financial assets with negative effective interest rate. Interest income on financial assets and on financial liabilities with a negative effective interest rate includes interest income on derivatives held for trading, debt securities, and loans and advances, as well as on deposits, debt securities issued, and other financial liabilities with a negative effective interest rate. Interest expenses on financial liabilities and on financial assets with a negative effective interest rate includes interest expenses on derivatives held for trading, deposits, debt securities issued and other financial liabilities, as well as on debt securities and loans and advances with a negative effective interest rate. For the purpose of template 16.1, short positions shall be considered within other financial liabilities. All instruments in the various portfolios are taken into account except those included in the items ‘Derivatives — Hedge accounting’ not used to hedge interest rate risk.
96.
Interest on derivatives held for trading includes the amounts related to those derivatives held for trading which qualify as ‘economic hedges’ that are included as interest income or expenses to correct the income and expense of the hedged financial instruments from an economic but not accounting point of view.
15.2.   Gains or losses on de-recognition of financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss by instrument (16.2)
97.
Gains and losses on de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss shall be broken down by type of financial instrument and by accounting portfolio. For each item, the net realised gain or loss stemming from the derecognised transaction shall be reported. The net amount represents the difference between realised gains and realised losses. Gains and losses of financial instruments classified as trading under the relevant National GAAP based on BAD shall not be reported in this template regardless of the valuation rules applicable for these instruments.
15.3.   Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading by instrument (16.3)
98.
Gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading shall be broken down by type of instrument; each item of the breakdown is the net realised and unrealised amount (gains minus losses) of the financial instrument. Gains and losses from foreign currency trading on the spot market, excluding exchange of foreign notes and coins, should be included as trading gains and losses. Gains and losses from precious metal trading should not be included in trading gains and losses as precious metals are not financial instruments.
15.4.   Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading by risk (16.4)
99.
Gains and losses on financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading shall also be broken down by type of risk; each item of the breakdown is the net realised and unrealised amount (gains minus losses) of the underlying risk (interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, credit, commodity and other) associated to the exposure, including related derivatives. Gains and losses from exchange differences shall be included in the item in which the rest of gains and losses arising from the converted instrument are included. Gains and losses on assets and liabilities other than derivatives shall be included as follows:
(a)
Interest rate: including trading of loans and advances, deposits and debt securities (held or issued);
(b)
Equity: including trading of shares, quotas of UCITS and other equity instruments;
(c)
Foreign exchange trading: including exclusively trading on foreign exchanges;
(d)
Credit risk: including trading of credit link notes;
(e)
Commodities: this item includes only derivatives because commodities held with trading intent shall be reported under ‘Other assets’ not under ‘Financial assets held for trading’.
(f)
Other: including trading of financial instruments which cannot be classified in other breakdowns.
15.5.   Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value to profit or loss by instrument (16.5)
100.
Gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss shall be broken down by type of instrument. Institutions shall report the net realised and unrealised and the amount of change in fair value in the period due to changes in the credit risk (own credit risk of the borrower or issuer).
15.6.   Gains or losses from hedge accounting (16.6)
101.
Gains and losses from hedge accounting shall be broken down by type of hedge accounting: fair value hedge, cash flow hedge and hedge of net investments in foreign operations. Gains and losses related to fair value hedge shall be broken down between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
15.7.   Impairment on financial and non-financial assets (16.7)
102.
‘Additions’ shall be reported when, for the accounting portfolio or main category of assets, the estimation of the impairment for the period results in recognition of net expenses. ‘Reversals’ shall be reported when, for the accounting portfolio or main category of assets, the estimation of the impairment for the period result in the recognition of net income.
16.   RECONCILIATION BETWEEN ACCOUNTING AND CRR SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION (17)
103.
‘Accounting scope of consolidation’ includes the carrying amount of assets, liabilities and equity as well as the nominal amounts of the off-balance sheet exposures prepared using the accounting scope of consolidation; that is, including in the consolidation insurance undertakings and non-financial corporations.
104.
In this template, the item ‘Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates’ shall not include subsidiaries as with the accounting scope of consolidation all subsidiaries are fully consolidated
105.
‘Assets under reinsurance and insurance contracts’ shall include assets under reinsurance ceded as well as, if any, assets related to insurance and reinsurance contracts issued.
106.
Liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts’ shall include liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts issued.
17.   GEOGRAPHICAL BREAKDOWN (20)
107.
Template 20 shall be reported when the institution exceeds the threshold described in Article 5.1(a)(iv). The geographical breakdown by location of the activities in templates 20.1 to 20.3 distinguishes between ‘domestic activities’ and ‘non-domestic activities’. ‘Location’ means the jurisdiction of incorporation of the legal entity which has recognized the corresponding asset or liability; for branches, it means the jurisdiction of its residence. For these purposes, ‘Domestic’ shall include the activities recognised in Member State where the institution is located.
108.
Templates 20.4 to 20.7 contain information ‘country-by-country’ on the basis of the residence of the immediate counterparty. The breakdown provided shall include exposures or liabilities with residents in each foreign country in which the institution has exposures. Exposures or liabilities with supranational organisations shall not be assigned to the country of residence of the institution but to the geographical area ‘Other countries’.
109.
In template 20.4 for debt instruments, ‘gross carrying amount’ shall be reported as defined in paragraph 45 of Part 2. For derivatives and equity instruments, the amount to be reported is the carrying amount. ‘Of which: Non-performing’ loans and advances shall be reported as defined in paragraphs 145 to157 of this Annex. Debt forbearance comprises all ‘debt’ contracts for the purpose of template 19 to which forbearance measures, as defined in paragraphs 163 to 179 of this Annex, are extended. Template 20.7 shall be reported with the classification by NACE Codes on a ‘country-by-country’ basis. NACE Codes shall be reported with the first level of disaggregation (by ‘section’).
18.   TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: ASSETS SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASE (21)
110.
For the purposes of the calculation of the threshold in Article 9(e) tangible assets that have been leased by the institution (lessor) to third parties in agreements that qualify as operating leases under the relevant accounting framework shall be divided by total of tangible assets.
111.
Under IFRS or compatible National GAAP, assets that have been leased by the institution (as lessor) to third parties in operating leases shall be reported broken down by measurement method.
19.   ASSET MANAGEMENT, CUSTODY AND OTHER SERVICE FUNCTIONS (22)
112.
For the purposes of the calculation of the threshold in Article 9(f), the amount of ‘net fee and commission income’ is the absolute value of the difference between ‘fee and commission income’ and ‘fee and commission expense’. For the same purposes, the amount of ‘net interest’ is the absolute value of the difference between ‘interest income’ and ‘interest expenses’.
19.1.   Fee and commission income and expenses by activity (22.1)
113.
The fee and commission income and expenses shall be reported by type of activity. Under IFRS or compatible National GAAP, this template includes fee and commission income and expenses other than:
(a)
amounts considered for the calculation of the effective interest of financial instruments [IFRS 7.20.(c)] and
(b)
amounts arising from financial instruments that are measured at fair value through profit or loss [IFRS 7.20.(c).(i)].
114.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial instruments not measured at fair value through profit or loss shall not be included; they form part of the initial acquisition/issue value of these instruments and are amortised to profit or loss over their residual life using the effective interest rate [see IAS 39.43].
115.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss shall be included as a part of ‘Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities held for trading, net’ or ‘Gains or losses on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, net’. They shall not be part of the initial acquisition or issuance value of these instruments and are immediately recognized in profit or loss.
116.
Institutions shall report fee and commission income and expenses according to the following criteria:
(a)
‘Securities. Issuances’ includes fees and commissions received for the involvement in the origination or issuance of securities not originated or issued by the institution;
(b)
‘Securities. Transfer orders’ includes fees and commissions generated by the reception, transmission and execution on behalf of customers of orders to buy or sell securities;
(c)
‘Securities. Other’ includes fees and commissions generated by the institution providing other services related with securities not originated or issued by the institution;
(d)
‘Clearing and settlement’ includes fee and commission income (expenses) generated by (charged to) the institution when participating in counterparty, clearing and settlement facilities;
(e)
‘Asset management’, ‘Custody’, ‘Central administrative services for collective investment undertakings’, ‘Fiduciary transactions’, ‘Payment services’ include fee and commission income (expenses) generated by (charged to) the institution when providing these services;
(f)
‘Structured finance’ includes fees and commissions received for the involvement in the origination or issuance of financial instruments other than securities originated or issued by the institution;
(g)
‘Servicing fees from securitisation activities’ includes, on the income side, the fee and commission income generated by the institution providing loan servicing services and on the expense side, the fee and commission expense charged to the institution by loan service providers;
(h)

29.   NON-PERFORMING EXPOSURES (18)
145.
For the purpose of template 18, non-performing exposures are those that satisfy any of the following criteria:
(a)
material exposures which are more than 90 days past due;
(b)
the debtor is assessed as unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full without realisation of collateral, regardless of the existence of any past due amount or of the number of days past due.
146.
That categorisation as non-performing exposures shall apply notwithstanding the classification of an exposure as defaulted for regulatory purposes in accordance with Article 178 of CRR or as impaired for accounting purposes in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.
147.
Exposures in respect of which a default is considered to have occurred in accordance with Article 178 CRR and exposures that have been found impaired in accordance with the applicable accounting framework shall always be considered as non-performing exposures. Exposures with ‘collective allowances for incurred but not reported losses’ referred to in paragraph 38 of this Annex shall not be considered as non-performing exposures unless they meet the criteria to be considered as non-performing exposures.
148.
Exposures shall be categorised for their entire amount and without taking into account the existence of any collateral. Materiality shall be assessed in accordance with Article 178 of CRR.
149.
For the purpose of template 18, ‘exposures’ includes all debt instruments (loans and advances which include also cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits and debt securities) and off-balance sheet exposures, except those held for trading exposures. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise the following revocable and irrevocable items:
(a)
loan commitments given;
(b)
financial guarantees given;
(c)
other commitments given.
Exposures include non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.
Under the relevant National GAAP based on BAD, portfolios ‘Non-trading debt instruments at a cost based method’ and ‘Other non-trading non-derivative financial assets’ shall be reported in the rows for ‘debt instruments at amortised cost’. Portfolios ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss’ and ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity’ shall be reported in the rows for ‘Debt instruments at fair value other than HFT’.
150.
For the purpose of template 18, an exposure is ‘past-due’ when any amount of principal, interest or fee has not been paid at the date it was due.
151.
For the purpose of template 18, ‘debtor’ means an obligor within the meaning of Article 178 of CRR.
152.
A commitment shall be considered as a non-performing exposure for its nominal amount where, when drawn down or otherwise used, it would lead to exposures that present a risk of not being paid back in full without realisation of collateral.
153.
Financial guarantees given shall be considered as non-performing exposures for their nominal amount where the financial guarantee is at risk of being called by the counterparty (‘guaranteed party’), including, in particular, where the underlying guaranteed exposure meets the criteria to be considered as non-performing, referred to in paragraph 145. Where the guaranteed party is past-due on the amount due under the financial guarantee contract, the reporting institution shall assess whether the resulting receivable meets the non-performing criteria.
154.
Exposures classified as non-performing in accordance with paragraph 145 shall be categorised as either non-performing on an individual basis (‘transaction based’) or as non-performing for the overall exposure to a given debtor (‘debtor based’). For the categorisation of non-performing exposures on an individual basis or to a given debtor, the following categorisation approaches shall be used for the different types of non-performing exposures:
(a)
for non-performing exposures classified as defaulted in accordance with Article 178 of CRR, the categorisation approach of Article 178 shall be applied;
(b)
for exposures that are classified as non-performing due to impairment under the applicable accounting framework, the recognition criteria for impairment under the applicable accounting framework shall be applied;
(c)
for other non-performing exposures that are neither classified as defaulted nor as impaired, the provisions of Article 178 of CRR for defaulted exposures shall be applied.
155.
Where an institution has on-balance sheet exposures to a debtor that are past due by more than 90 days and the gross carrying amount of the past due exposures represents more than 20 % of the gross carrying amount of all on-balance sheet exposures to that debtor, all on- and off-balance sheet exposures to that debtor shall be considered as non-performing. When a debtor belongs to a group, the need to also consider exposures to other entities of the group as non-performing shall be assessed, where they are not already considered as impaired or defaulted in accordance with Article 178 of CRR, except for exposures affected by isolated disputes that are unrelated to the solvency of the counterparty.
156.
Exposures shall be considered to have ceased being non-performing when all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the exposure meets the exit criteria applied by the reporting institution for the discontinuation of the impairment and default classification;
(b)
the situation of the debtor has improved to the extent that full repayment, according to the original or when applicable the modified conditions, is likely to be made;
(c)
the debtor does not have any amount past-due by more than 90 days.
An exposure shall remain classified as non-performing while those conditions are not met, even though the exposure has already met the discontinuation criteria applied by the reporting institution for the impairment and default classification according to the applicable accounting framework and Article 178 of CRR respectively.
The classification of a non-performing exposure as non-current asset held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 does not discontinue their classification as non-performing exposure, as non-current assets held for sale are included in the scope of definition of non-performing exposures.
157.
In case of non-performing exposures with forbearance measures (6), those exposures shall be considered to have ceased being non-performing where all the following conditions are met:
(a)
exposures are not considered to be impaired or defaulted;
(b)
one year has passed since the forbearance measures were applied;
(c)
there is not, following the forbearance measures, any past-due amount or concern regarding the full repayment of the exposure according to the post-forbearance conditions. The absence of concerns shall be determined after an analysis of the debtor’s financial situation by the institution. Concerns may be considered as no longer existing where the debtor has paid, via its regular payments in accordance with the post-forbearance conditions, a total equal to the amount that was previously past-due (where there were past-due amounts) or that has been written-off (where there were no past-due amounts) under the forbearance measures or the debtor has otherwise demonstrated its ability to comply with the post-forbearance conditions.
Those specific exit conditions shall apply in addition to the criteria applied by reporting institutions for impaired and defaulted exposures according to the applicable accounting framework and Article 178 of CRR respectively.
158.
Past due exposures shall be reported separately within the performing and non-performing categories for their entire amount. Performing exposures past due by less than 90 days shall be reported separately for their entire amount.
159.
Non-performing exposures shall be reported broken down by past due time bands. Exposures that are not past due or are past due by 90 days or less but nevertheless are identified as non-performing due to the likelihood of non-full repayment shall be reported in a dedicated column. Exposures that present both past due amounts and a likelihood of non-full repayment shall be allocated by past-due time bands consistent with the number of days that they are past due.
Cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits shall be reported in row 070 as well as in rows 080 and 100 of template 18.
Non-performing exposures classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 shall not be reported in template 18.
160.
The following exposures shall be identified in separate columns:
(a)
exposures which are considered to be impaired in accordance with the applicable accounting framework, except where they are exposures with incurred but not reported losses;
(b)
exposures in respect of which a default is considered to have occurred in accordance with Article 178 of CRR.
161.
‘Accumulated impairment’ and ‘accumulated changes in fair value due to credit risk’ figures shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 46. ‘Accumulated impairment’ means the reduction in the carrying amount of the exposure either directly or through the use of an allowance account. Accumulated impairment reported on non-performing exposures shall not include incurred but not reported losses. Incurred but not reported losses shall be reported in accumulated impairment on performing exposures. ‘Accumulated changes in fair value due to credit risk’ shall be reported for exposures designated at fair value through profit and loss in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.
162.
Information on collateral held and financial guarantee received on non-performing exposures shall be reported separately. Amounts reported for collateral received and financial guarantees received shall be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 79 to 82. Therefore, the sum of the amounts reported for both collateral and financial guarantees shall be capped at the carrying amount of the related exposure.
30.   FORBORNE EXPOSURES (19)
163.
For the purpose of template 19, forborne exposures are debt contracts in respect of which forbearance measures have been applied. Forbearance measures consist of concessions towards a debtor that is experiencing or about to experience difficulties in meeting its financial commitments (‘financial difficulties’).
164.
For the purpose of template 19, a concession refers to either of the following actions:
(a)
a modification of the previous terms and conditions of a contract that the debtor is considered unable to comply with due to its financial difficulties (‘troubled debt’) resulting in insufficient debt service ability and that would not have been granted had the debtor not been experiencing financial difficulties;
(b)
a total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract, that would not have been granted had the debtor not been experiencing financial difficulties.
A concession may entail a loss for the lender.
165.
Evidence of a concession includes the following:
(a)
a difference in favour of the debtor between the modified terms of the contract and the previous terms of the contract;
(b)
inclusion in a modified contract of more favourable terms than other debtors with a similar risk profile could have obtained from the same institution at that time.
166.
The exercise of clauses which, when used at the discretion of the debtor, enable the debtor to change the terms of the contract (‘embedded forbearance clauses’) shall be treated as a concession when the institution approves executing those clauses and concludes that the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties.
167.
‘Refinancing’ means the use of debt contracts to ensure the total or partial payment of other debt contracts the current terms of which the debtor is unable to comply with.
168.
For the purpose of template 19, ‘debtor’ includes all the natural and legal entities in the debtor’s group which are within the accounting scope of consolidation.
169.
For the purpose of template 19, ‘debt’ includes loans and advances (which include also cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits), debt securities and revocable and irrevocable loan commitments given, but excludes exposures held for trading. ‘Debt’ includes non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.
Under the relevant National GAAP based on BAD, portfolios ‘Non-trading debt instruments at a cost based method’ and ‘Other non-trading non-derivative financial assets’ shall be reported in the rows for ‘debt instruments at amortised cost’. Portfolios ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss’ and ‘Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity’ shall be reported in the rows for ‘Debt instruments at fair value other than HFT’.
170.
For the purpose of template 19, ‘exposure’ has the same meaning as given for ‘debt’ in paragraph 169.
171.
For the purpose of template 19, ‘institution’ means the institution which applied the forbearance measures.
172.
Exposures shall be regarded as forborne where a concession has been made, irrespective of whether any amount is past due or of the classification of the exposures as impaired in accordance with the applicable accounting framework or as defaulted in accordance with Article 178 of CRR. Exposures shall not be treated as forborne where the debtor is not in financial difficulties. Nevertheless the following shall be treated as forbearance measures:
(a)
a modified contract that has been classified as non-performing before the modification or would in the absence of modification be classified as non-performing;
(b)
the modification that has been made to a contract involves a total or partial cancellation by write-offs of the debt;
(c)
the institution approves the use of embedded forbearance clauses for a debtor who is non-performing or who would be considered as non-performing without the use of those clauses;
(d)
simultaneously with or close in time to the concession of additional debt by the institution, the debtor made payments of principal or interest on another contract with the institution that was non-performing or would in the absence of refinancing be classified as non-performing.
173.
A modification involving repayments made by taking possession of collateral shall be treated as a forbearance measure where that modification constitutes a concession.
174.
There is a rebuttable presumption that forbearance has taken place in the following circumstances:
(a)
the modified contract was totally or partially past due by more than 30 days (without being non-performing) at least once during the three months prior to its modification or would be more than 30 days past due, totally or partially, without modification;
(b)
simultaneously with or close in time to the concession of additional debt by the institution, the debtor made payments of principal or interest on another contract with the institution that was totally or partially past due by 30 days at least once during the three months prior to its refinancing;
(c)
the institution approves the use of embedded forbearance clauses for 30 days past due debtors or debtors who would be 30 days past due without the exercise of those clauses.
175.
Financial difficulties shall be assessed at debtor level as referred to in paragraph 168. Only exposures to which forbearance measures have been applied shall be identified as forborne exposures.
176.
Forborne exposures shall be included within the non-performing exposures category or the performing exposures category in accordance with paragraphs 145 to 162 and 177 to 179. The classification as forborne exposure shall be discontinued when all of the following conditions are met:
(a)
the forborne exposure is considered to be performing, including where it has been reclassified from the non-performing exposures category after an analysis of the financial condition of the debtor showed that it no longer met the conditions to be considered as non-performing;
(b)
a minimum two year probation period has passed from the date the forborne exposure was considered to be performing;
(c)
regular payments of more than an insignificant aggregate amount of principal or interest have been made during at least half of the probation period;
(d)
none of the exposures to the debtor is more than 30 days past due at the end of the probation period.
177.
Where the conditions referred to in paragraph 176 are not met at the end of the probation period, the exposure shall continue to be identified as performing forborne under probation until all the conditions are met. The conditions shall be assessed on at least a quarterly basis. Forborne exposures which are classified as non-current assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 continue to be classified as forborne exposures, as non-current assets held for sale are included in the scope of the definition of forborne exposures.
178.
A forborne exposure may be considered as performing from the date the forbearance measures were applied where either of the following conditions is met:
(a)
that extension has not led the exposure to be classified as non-performing;
(b)
the exposure was not considered to be a non-performing exposure at the date the forbearance measures were extended.
179.
Where additional forbearance measures are applied to a performing forborne exposure under probation that has been reclassified out of the non-performing category or it becomes more than 30 days past due, it shall be classified as non-performing.
180.
‘Performing exposures with forbearance measures’ (performing forborne exposures) comprise forborne exposures that do not meet the criteria to be considered as non-performing and are included in the performing exposures category. Performing forborne exposures are under probation according to paragraph 176, including when paragraph 178 applies. Forborne exposures under probation that have been reclassified out of the non-performing exposures category shall be reported separately within the performing exposures with forbearance measures in the column ‘of which: Performing forborne exposures under probation’.
‘Non-performing exposures with forbearance measures’ (non-performing forborne exposures) comprise forborne exposures that meet the criteria to be considered as non-performing and are included in the non-performing exposures category. Those non-performing forborne exposures include the following:
(a)
exposures which have become non-performing due to the application of forbearance measures;
(b)
exposures which were non-performing prior to the extension of forbearance measures;
(c)
forborne exposures which have been reclassified from the performing category, including exposures reclassified in application of paragraph 179.
Where forbearance measures are extended to non-performing exposures, the amount of those forborne exposures shall be separately identified in the column ‘of which: forbearance of non-performing exposures’.
Forborne exposures classified as cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits shall be reported in row 070 as well as in rows 080 and 100 of template 19.
Forborne exposures classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 shall not be reported in template 19.
181.
The column ‘Refinancing’ comprises the gross carrying amount of the new contract (‘refinancing debt’) granted as part of a refinancing transaction which qualifies as a forbearance measure, as well as the gross carrying amount of the old re-paid contract that is still outstanding.
182.
Forborne exposures combining modifications and refinancing shall be allocated to the column ‘Instruments with modifications of the terms and conditions’ or the column ‘Refinancing’ according to the measure that has the most impact on cash-flows. Refinancing by a pool of banks shall be reported in the column ‘Refinancing’ for the total amount of refinancing debt provided by or refinanced debt still outstanding at the reporting institution. Repackaging of several debts into a new debt shall be reported as a modification, unless there is also a refinancing transaction that has a larger impact on cash-flows. Where forbearance through modification of the terms and conditions of a troubled exposure leads to its de-recognition and to the recognition of a new exposure, that new exposure shall be treated as forborne debt.
183.
Accumulated impairment and accumulated changes in fair value due to credit risk shall be reported in accordance with paragraph 46. ‘Accumulated impairment’ means the reduction in the carrying amount of the exposure either directly or through the use of an allowance account. The amount of ‘accumulated impairment’ to be reported in the column ‘on non-performing exposures with forbearance measures’ for non-performing exposures shall not include incurred but not reported losses. Incurred but not reported losses shall be reported in the column ‘on performing exposures with forbearance measures’. ‘Accumulated changes in fair value due to credit risk’ are reported for exposures designated at fair value through profit and loss in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE REPORTING ON LOSSES STEMMING FROM LENDING COLLATERALISED BY IMMOVABLE PROPERTY
1.
This Annex contains additional instructions in relation to the tables included in Annex VI of this Regulation. This Annex complements the instructions in format of references included in the tables in Annex VI.
2.
All the general instructions included in Part I of Annex II of this regulation shall also apply.
1.   Reporting scope
3.
Data specified in Article 101(1) of CRR is subject to reporting by all institutions using immovable property for the purposes of Part Three, Title II of CRR.
4.
The template covers all national markets an institution/group of institution is exposed to (see Article 101(1) CRR). According to Article 101(2) sentence 3 the data shall be reported for each property market within the Union separately.
2.   Definitions
5.
Definition of loss: ‘Loss’ means ‘economic loss’ as defined in Article 5(2) CRR, including losses stemming from leased property. The recovery flows stemming from other sources (e.g. bank guarantees, life insurance, etc.) shall not be recognised when calculating losses stemming from immovable property. Losses of one position shall not be netted with the profit of a successful recovery of another position.
6.
According to the definition of Article 5(2) CRR, for exposures secured by residential and commercial property the calculation of economic loss should start from outstanding exposure value at reporting date and should include at least: (i) proceeds from collateral realisation; (ii) direct costs (including interest rates payments and workouts costs linked to the liquidation of the collateral); and (iii) indirect costs (including operating costs of the workout unit). All components need to be discounted to the reporting reference date.
7.
Exposure value: The exposure value follows the rules stipulated in Part Three, Title II of CRR (see Chapter 2 for institutions using the standardised approach, and Chapter 3 for institutions using the IRB approach).
8.
Property value: The property value follows the rules stipulated in Part Three, Title II of CRR
9.
F/X effect: The reporting currency shall be used with the exchange rate at the reporting date. Moreover, the estimates of the economic losses should consider the F/X effect if the exposure or collateral is denominated in different currency.
3.   Geographical breakdown
10.
Following the reporting scope, the CR IP Losses reporting shall consist of the following templates:
a)
one total template
b)
one template for each national market in the Union where the institution is exposed to, and
c)
one template aggregating the data for all national markets outside the Union where the institution is exposed to.
4.   Reporting of exposures and losses
11.
Exposures: All exposures that are treated according to Part Three, Title II of CRR and where the collateral is used to reduce own funds requirements, are reported in CR IP Losses. This also means that in case the risk mitigation effect of immovable property is only used for internal purposes (i.e. under Pillar 2) or for large exposures (see Part Four CRR), the exposures and losses concerned must not reported.
12.
Losses: The institution which has the exposure by the end of the reporting period shall report the losses. Losses shall be reported as soon as provisions are to be booked according to accounting rules. Also estimated losses should be reported. Loss data shall be collected on a loan-by-loan basis, i.e. aggregation of individual loss data stemming from exposures collateralised by immovable property.
13.
Reference date: The exposure value from the date of default should be used for reporting of losses.
a)
Losses should be reported for all defaults on loans secured by real estate property that occur during the respective reporting period and irrespective of whether the work out is completed during the period or not. Loss data reported as of 30 June shall refer to the period 1 January until 30 June and loss data reported as of 31 December shall refer to the whole calendar year. Since there may be a long time lag between default and loss realisation, loss estimates (which includes incomplete workout process) shall be reported in cases where the workout has not been completed within the reporting period.
b)
For all defaults observed within the reporting period, there are three scenarios: (i.) defaulted loan can be restructured so that it is no longer treated as in default (no loss observed); (ii.) realization of all collateral is completed (completed workout, actual loss known); or (iii.) incomplete workout (loss estimates to be used). Loss reporting shall include only losses stemming from scenario (ii.) realisation of collateral (observed losses) and scenario (iii.) incomplete workout (estimates of losses).
c)
As losses shall be reported only for exposures having defaulted during the reporting period, changes to losses of exposures having defaulted during previous reporting periods will not be reflected in the reported data. I.e. proceeds from the realisation of the collateral at a later reporting period or lower realised costs than previously estimated shall not be reported.
14.
Role of the valuation of the property: The latest valuation of the property before the default date of the exposure is needed as reference date for reporting the part of exposure secured by mortgages on immovable property. After default, the property might be re-valued. This new value should however not be relevant for identifying the part of the exposure which was originally fully (and completely) secured by the mortgages on immovable property. However the new value of the property shall be considered in economic loss reporting (a reduced property value is part of economic costs). In other words, the latest valuation of the property before the default date shall be used to determine which part of the loss shall be reported in cell 010 (identification of exposure values which is fully and completely secured) and the re-valued property value for the amount to be reported (estimation a possible workout from collateral) in cells 010 and 030.
15.
Treatment of loan sales during the reporting period: The institution which has the exposure by the end of the reporting period shall report losses, but only if a default for that exposure was identified.

Where there is a negative sign (-) preceding the label of an item, no positive figure shall be reported for that item.
PART II:   TEMPLATE RELATED INSTRUCTIONS
In this Annex, instructions relating to the reporting of Large Exposures shall also apply to the reporting of significant exposures required by Articles 9 and 11, in accordance with the scope defined in those Articles.
1.   Scope and level of the LE reporting
1.
In order to report information on large exposures to clients or groups of connected clients according to Article 394(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (‘CRR’) on a solo basis, institutions shall use the templates LE1, LE2 and LE3.
2.
In order to report information on large exposures to clients or groups of connected clients according to Article 394(1) of CRR on a consolidated basis, the parent institutions in a Member State shall use templates LE1, LE2 and LE3.
3.
Every large exposure defined in accordance with Article 392 of CRR shall be reported, including the large exposures that shall not be considered for the compliance with the large exposure limit laid down in Article 395 of CRR.
4.
In order to report information on the 20 largest exposures to clients or groups of connected clients according to the last sentence of Article 394(1) of CRR on a consolidated basis, the parent institutions in a Member State which are subject to Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, of CRR shall use templates LE1, LE2 and LE3. The exposure value resulting from subtracting the amount in column 320 (‘Amounts exempted’) of template LE2 from the amount in column 210 (‘Total’) of that same template is the amount that shall be used for determining these 20 largest exposures.
5.
In order to report information on the ten largest exposures to institutions as well as on the ten largest exposures to unregulated financial sector entities according to points (a) to (d) of Article 394(2) of CRR on a consolidated basis, the parent institutions in a Member State shall use templates LE1, LE2 and LE3. For the reporting of the maturity structure of these exposures according to Article 394(2)(e) of CRR, the parent institutions in a Member State shall use templates LE4 and LE5. The exposure value calculated in column 210 (‘Total’) of template LE2 is the amount that shall be used for determining these 20 largest exposures.
6.
The data on the large exposures and the relevant largest exposures to groups of connected clients and individual clients not belonging to a group of connected clients shall be reported in the template LE2 (in which a group of connected clients shall be reported as one single exposure.
7.
Institutions shall report in the LE3 template data regarding the exposures to individual clients belonging to the groups of connected clients, which are reported in the LE2 template. The reporting of an exposure to an individual client in the LE2 template shall not be duplicated in the LE3 template.
2.   Structure of the LE template
8.
The columns of the template LE1 shall present the information related to the identification of individual clients or groups of connected clients to which an institution has an exposure.
9.
The columns of the templates LE2 and LE3 shall present the following blocks of information:
(a)
the exposure value before application of exemptions and before taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation, including the direct, indirect exposure and additional exposures arising from transactions where there is an exposure to underlying assets;
(b)
the effect of the exemptions and of the credit risk mitigation techniques;
(c)
the exposure value after application of exemptions and after taking into account the effect of the credit risk mitigation calculated for the purpose of Article 395(1) of CRR.
10.
The columns of the templates LE4 and LE5 shall present the information regarding the maturity buckets to which the expected maturing amounts of the ten largest exposures to institutions as well as the ten largest exposures to unregulated financial sector entities shall be allocated.
3.   Definitions and general instructions for the purposes of the LE reporting
11.
‘Group of connected clients’ is defined in Article 4(1)(39) of CRR.

Exposures towards civil law associations featuring quotas shall be divided or allocated to the partners according to their respective quotas. Certain constructions (e.g. joint accounts, communities of heirs, straw-man loans) working in fact civil law associations have to be reported just like them.
15.
Assets and off balance sheet items shall be used without risk weights or degrees of risk in accordance to Article 389 of CRR. Specifically, credit conversion factors shall not be applied to off balance sheet items.
16.
‘Exposures’ are defined in Article 389 of CRR.
(a)
any asset or off-balance sheet items in the non-trading and trading book including items set out in Article 400 of CRR, but excluding items which fall under effect of points (a) to (d) of Article 390(6) of CRR.

‘indirect exposures’ are those exposures allocated to the guarantor or to the issuer of the collateral rather than to the immediate borrower in accordance with Article 403 of CRR. The definitions here may not differ in any possible respect from the definitions provided in the basic act.]
The exposures to groups of connected clients shall be calculated in accordance with Article 390(5).
17.
The ‘netting agreements’ shall be allowed to be taken into account to the effects of large exposures exposure value as laid down in Article 390(1), (2) and (3) of CRR. The exposure value of a derivative instrument listed in Annex II of CRR shall be determined in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, of CRR with the effects of contracts of novation and other netting agreements taken into account for the purposes of those methods in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, of CRR. The exposure value of repurchase transaction, securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions, long settlement transactions and margin lending transactions may be determined either in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 or Chapter 6, of CRR. In accordance with Article 296 of CRR, the exposure value of a single legal obligation arising from the contractual cross-product netting agreement with a counterparty of the reporting institution shall be reported as ‘other commitments’ in the LE templates.
18.
The ‘value of an exposure’ shall be calculated according to Article 390 of CRR.
19.
The effect of the full or partial application of exemptions and eligible credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques for the purposes of calculating of exposures for the purpose of Article 395(1) CRR is described in Articles 399 to 403 of CRR.
20.
Reverse repurchase agreements which fall under the reporting for large exposures shall be reported according to Article 402(3) of CRR. Provided that the criteria in Article 402(3) of CRR are met the institution shall report the large exposures to each third party for the amount of the claim that the counterparty to the transaction has on this third party and not for the amount of the exposure to the counterparty.

Counterparty Identification:
Institutions shall report the identification of any counterparty for which information is being submitted in any of the templates C 28.00 to C 31.00. The identification of the group of connected clients shall not be reported, unless the national reporting system provides a unique code for the group of connected clients.
According to Article 394(1)(a) of CRR, institutions shall report the identification of the counterparty to which they have a large exposure as defined in Article 392 of CRR.
According to Article 394(2)(a) of CRR, institutions shall report the identification of the counterparty to which they have the largest exposures (in the cases where the counterparty is an institution or an unregulated financial sector entity).
010
Code
The code is a row identifier, and must be unique for each row in the table.
The code shall be used to identify the individual counterparty. However, the purpose of this column is to link counterparty details in C 27.00 with exposures reported in C 28.00 – C 31.00. The code of the group of connected clients shall not be reported, unless the national reporting system provides a unique code for the group of connected clients. The codes shall be used in a consistent way across time.
The composition of the code depends on the national reporting system, unless a uniform codification is available in the Union.
020
Name
The name shall correspond to the name of the group whenever a group of connected clients is reported. In any other case, the name shall correspond to the individual counterparty.
For a group of connected clients, the name that shall be reported shall be the name of the parent company or, when the group of connected clients does not have a parent, it shall be the group’s commercial name.
030
LEI Code
The legal entity identifier code of the counterparty.
040
Residence of the counterparty
The ISO code 3166-1-alpha-2 of the country of incorporation of the counterparty shall be used (including pseudo-ISO codes for international organisations, available in the last edition of the Eurostat’s ‘Balance of Payments Vademecum’)
For groups of connected clients, no residence shall be reported.
050
Sector of the counterparty
One sector shall be allocated to every counterparty on the basis of FINREP economic sector classes:
(i) Central Banks; (ii) General Governments; (iii) Credit institutions; (iv) Other financial corporations; (v) Non-financial corporations; (vi) households.
For groups of connected clients, no sector shall be reported.

NACE code
For the economic sector, the NACE codes (Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans l’Union européenne = Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Union) shall be used.
This column shall apply only for the counterparties ‘Other financial corporations’ and ‘Non-financial corporations’. NACE codes shall be used for ‘Non-financial corporations’ with one level detail (e.g. ‘F – Construction’) and for ‘Other financial corporations’ with a two level detail, which provides separate information on insurance activities (e.g. ‘K65 — Insurance, reinsurance and pension funding, except compulsory social security’).
The ‘Other financial corporations’ and ‘Non-financial corporations’ economic sectors shall be classified on the basis of FINREP counterparty breakdown.
For groups of connected clients, no NACE code shall be reported.
070
Type of counterparty
Article 394(2) of CRR
The type of the counterparty of the ten largest exposures to institutions and the ten largest exposures to unregulated financial sector entities shall be specified by using ‘I’ for institutions or ‘U’ for unregulated financial sector entities.

Maturity buckets of the exposure
Article 394(2)(e) of CRR
The institution shall report this information for the ten largest exposures to institutions and the ten largest exposures to unregulated financial sector entities.
The maturity buckets are defined with a monthly interval up to one year, with a quarterly interval from one year up to three years and with larger intervals from three years onwards.
Each exposure value before application of exemptions and CRM (column 210 of LE2 template) shall be reported with the whole outstanding amount in the respective maturity bucket of its expected residual maturity. In case of several separate relationships constituting an exposure to a client, each of these parts of the exposure shall be reported with the whole outstanding amount in the respective maturity bucket of its expected residual maturity. Instruments which do not have a fixed maturity, like equity, shall be included in the column ‘undefined maturity’.
The expected maturity of the exposure shall be reported for both direct and indirect exposures.
For direct exposures, when allocating expected amounts of equity instruments, debt instruments and derivatives into the different maturity buckets of this template, the instructions of the maturity ladder template of the additional metrics on liquidity shall be used (see consultation paper CP18 published on 23.05.2013).
In the case of off-balance sheet items, the maturity of the underlying risk shall be used in the allocation of expected amounts to maturity buckets. More specifically, for forward deposits that means the maturity structure of the deposit; for financial guarantees, the maturity structure of the underlying financial asset; for undrawn facilities of loan commitments, the maturity structure of the loan; and for other commitments, the maturing structure of the commitment.
In the case of indirect exposures, the allocation into maturity buckets shall be based on the maturity of the guaranteed operations which generate the direct exposure.
In case an exposure or a part of an exposure is to be regarded as defaulted and is reported as such in template C 28.00 (LE 2, column 050) and C 29.00 (LE 3, column 060), the expected run-off of the defaulted exposure must be allocated to the respective maturity buckets as follows:
—
When the reporting entity, in spite of the default, has a clear calendar of expected repayments of the exposure, it shall allocate them into the respective buckets accordingly.
—
When the reporting entity does not have a reasoned view of when defaulted amounts will be repaid (if ever), it shall allocate them into the category ‘undefined maturity’.
