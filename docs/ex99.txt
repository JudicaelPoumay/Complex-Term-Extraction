COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2018/1627
of 9 October 2018
amending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 as regards prudent valuation for supervisory reporting
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (1) and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 99(5), the fourth subparagraph of Article 99(6), the third subparagraph of Article 394(4) the fourth subparagraph of Article 415(3) and the third subparagraph of Article 430(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (2) specifies the modalities according to which institutions are required to report information relevant to their compliance with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. The regulatory framework established by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is gradually being supplemented and amended in its non-essential elements by the adoption of further regulatory technical standards. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 needs to be updated to reflect those changes.
(2)
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is supplemented by the adoption of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 (3), with regard to prudent valuation and by Regulation (EU) 2017/2401 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), with regard to securitisation. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 should be updated to reflect those changes and to provide further precision in the instructions and definitions used for the purposes of the institutions’ supervisory reporting. Certain references and formatting inconsistencies which were discovered as misleading in the course of the application of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 should also be clarified.
(3)
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 sets out requirements relating to prudent valuation adjustments of fair-valued positions. It provides two approaches for the implementation of the prudent valuation requirements: a core approach and a simplified approach. To monitor compliance of institutions with those requirements and to assess the impact of that Regulation on valuation adjustments, additional reporting, relating to the prudent valuation requirements, is necessary.
(4)
Regulation (EU) 2017/2401 amends Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to make the capital treatment of securitisations more risk-sensitive and able to reflect properly the specific features of simple, transparent and standardised securitisations. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 needs to be amended to accommodate the reporting on securitisation positions subject to this revised securitisation framework.
(5)
Amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 are also necessary to improve competent authorities’ ability to effectively monitor and assess the institutions’ risk profile and to obtain a view on the risks posed to the financial sector, which requires minor changes to the reporting requirements on the geographical distribution of exposures.
(6)
This Regulation is based on the draft implementing technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) to the Commission.
(7)
EBA has conducted open public consultations on the draft implementing technical standards on which this Regulation is based that relate to prudent valuation and the total geographical breakdown, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) in relation to those. In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 15(1) of that Regulation, EBA has not conducted any open public consultation with regard to those parts of the draft implementing technical standards on which this Regulation is based that are either of editorial nature or introduce only a limited number of items in the supervisory reporting framework, as such consultation would be disproportionate in relation to the scope and impact of the draft implementing technical standards concerned.
(8)
Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
_Article 1
Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 is amended as follows:
(1)
Article 5 is amended as follows:
(a)
point (a) is amended as follows:

(ii)
in addition to the reporting referred to in point (i), institutions that apply the core approach pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/101 shall also report the information specified in template 32.2 of Annex I in accordance with the instructions in Part II, point 6 of Annex II;
(iii)
in addition to the requirements referred to in points (i) and (ii), institutions that apply the core approach pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/101 and which exceed the threshold referred to in Article 4(1) of that Regulation at their respective reporting level, shall also report the information specified in templates 32.3 and 32.4 of Annex I in accordance with the instructions in Part II, point 6 of Annex II.
For the purposes of point (a)(12), the entry and exit criteria of Article 4 shall not apply.’;

(4)
Annex II is replaced by the text set out in Annex II to this Regulation;
(5)

PART II: TEMPLATE RELATED INSTRUCTIONS
1.   CAPITAL ADEQUACY OVERVIEW (CA)
1.1.   GENERAL REMARKS
10.
(a)
CA1 template contains the amount of own funds of the institutions, disaggregated in the items needed to get to that amount. The amount of own funds obtained includes the aggregate effect of transitional provisions per type of capital
(b)
CA2 template summarizes the total risk exposures amounts as defined in Article 92(3) of CRR
(c)
CA3 template contains the ratios for which CRR state a minimum level, and some other related data
(d)
CA4 template contains memorandums items needed for calculating items in CA1 as well as information with regard to the CRD capital buffers.
(e)
CA5 template contains the data needed for calculating the effect of transitional provisions in own funds. CA5 will cease to exist once the transitional provisions will expire.
11.
12.
13.
(a)
The items in CA1 are generally gross of transitional adjustments. This means that figures in CA1 items are calculated according to the final provisions (i.e. as if there were no transitional provisions), with the exception of items summarizing the effect of the transitional provisions. For each type of capital (i.e. CET1; AT1 and T2) there are three different items in which all the adjustments due to transitional provisions are included.
(b)
Transitional provisions may also affect the AT1 and the T2 shortfall (i.e. AT1 or T2 the excess of deduction, regulated in Articles 36(1) point (j) and 56 point (e) of CRR respectively), and thus the items containing these shortfalls may indirectly reflect the effect of transitional provisions.
(c)
Template CA5 is exclusively used for reporting the transitional provisions.
14.
a)
The templates CA1, CA2 or CA5 only contain data on Pillar I issues.
b)
The template CA3 contains the impact of additional Pillar II-requirements on the solvency ratio on an aggregated basis. One block focuses on the impact of amounts on the ratios, whereas the other block focuses on the ratio itself. Both blocks of ratios do not have any further link to the templates CA1, CA2 or CA5.
c)
The template CA4 contains one cell regarding additional own funds requirements relating to Pillar II. This cell has no link via validation rules to the capital ratios of the CA3 template and reflects Article 104(2) CRD which explicitly mentions additional own funds requirements as one possibility for Pillar II decisions.

Adjustments included in RWAs
Column 040 includes the relevant amounts adjusting the total risk exposure amount of Article 92(3) of CRR due to transitional provisions. The amounts reported shall consider the application of provisions of Chapter 2 or 3 of Title II of Part Three or of Title IV of Part Three in accordance with Art. 92 (4) of CRR. This means that transitional amounts subject to provisions of Chapter 2 or 3 of Title II of Part Three shall be reported as risk weighted exposure amounts, whereas transitional amounts subject to Title IV of Part Three shall represent the own funds requirements multiplied by 12.5.
Whereas columns 010 to 030 have a direct link to the CA1 template, the adjustments to the total risk exposure amount do not have a direct link to the relevant templates for credit risk. If there are adjustments stemming from the transitional provisions to the total risk exposure amount, those adjustments shall be included directly in the CR SA, CR IRB, CR EQU IRB, MKR SA TDI, MKR SA EQU or MKR IM. Additionally, those effects shall be reported in column 040 of CA5.1. As a consequence, those amounts are only memorandum items.

INFORMATION ON ENTITIES SUBJECT TO OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENT
The section of detailed information (i.e. columns 070 to 240) shall gather information only on those entities and subgroups which, being within the scope of consolidation (Chapter 2 of Title II of Part One of CRR), are effectively subject to solvency requirements according to CRR or provisions at least equivalent to Basel provisions (i.e, reported yes in column 030).
Information shall be included about all individual institutions of a consolidated group that are subject to own funds requirements, regardless where they are located.
The information reported in this part shall be according to the local solvency rules where the institution is operating (therefore for this template it is not necessary to do a double calculation on an individual basis according to the parent institution’s rules). When local solvency rules differ from CRR and a comparable breakdown is not given, the information shall be completed where data is available in the respective granularity. Therefore, this part is a factual template that summarises the calculations that the individual institutions of a group shall carry out, bearing in mind that some of those institutions may be subject to different solvency rules.

DECISION TREE ON HOW TO ASSIGN THE ORIGINAL EXPOSURE PRE CONVERSION FACTORS TO THE EXPOSURE CLASSES OF THE STANDARDISED APPROACH ACCORDING TO CRR
Original exposure pre conversion factors


Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 (m)?

Securitisation positions



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112point (k)?

Items associated with particular high risk (also see Article 128)



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (p)?

Equity exposures (also see Article 133)



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (j)?

Exposures in default



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure classes of Article 112 points (l) and (o)?

Exposures in the form of units or shares in collective investment undertakings (CIU)
Exposures in the form of covered bonds (also see Article 129)
These two exposure classes are disjoint among themselves (see comments on the look-through approach in the answer above). Therefore the assignment to one of them is straightforward.



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (i)?

Exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property (also see Article 124)



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (q)?

Other items



Does it fit for being assigned to the exposure class of Article 112 point (n)?

Exposures to institutions and corporates with a short-term credit assessment



The exposure classes below are disjoint among themselves. Therefore the assignment to one of them is straightforward.
Exposures to central governments or central banks
Exposures to regional governments or local authorities
Exposures to public sector entities
Exposures to multilateral development banks
Exposures to international organisations
Exposures to institutions
Exposures to corporates

INTERNAL RATING SYSTEM/PD ASSIGNED TO THE OBLIGOR GRADE OR POOL (%)
The PD assigned to the obligor grade or pool to be reported shall be based on the provisions laid down in Article 180 of CRR. For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to the specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. For figures corresponding to an aggregation of obligor grades or pools (e.g. total exposures) the exposure weighted average of the PDs assigned to the obligor grades or pools included in the aggregation shall be provided. The exposure value (column 110) shall be used for the calculation of the exposure-weighted average PD.
For each individual grade or pool the PD assigned to the specific obligor grade or pool shall be reported. All reported risk parameters shall be derived from the risk parameters used in the internal rating system approved by the respective competent authority.
It is neither intended nor desirable to have a supervisory master scale. If the reporting institution applies a unique rating system or is able to report according to an internal master scale, this scale is used.
Otherwise, the different rating systems shall be merged and ordered according to the following criteria: Obligor grades of the different rating systems shall be pooled and ordered from the lower PD assigned to each obligor grade to the higher. Where the institution uses a large number of grades or pools, a reduced number of grades or pools to be reported may be agreed with the competent authorities.
Institutions shall contact their competent authority in advance, if they want to report a different number of grades in comparison with the internal number of grades.
For the purposes of weighting the average PD the exposure value reported in column 110 is used. All exposures, including defaulted exposures are to be considered for the purpose of the calculation of the exposure weighted average PD (e.g. for “total exposure”). Defaulted exposures are those assigned to the last rating grade/s with a PD of 100 %.

060
(-) UNFUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION: ADJUSTED VALUES (GA)
Unfunded credit protection is defined in Article 4(1)(59) of CRR.
Article 236 of CRR describes the computation procedure of GA in the case of full protection/partial protection — equal seniority.
This piece of information is related to columns 040 and 050 of the CR IRB template.
070
(-) FUNDED CREDIT PROTECTION
Funded credit protection is defined in Article 4(1)(58) of CRR.
Since the Financial Collateral Simple Method is not applicable, only funded credit protection according to Article 200 of CRR shall be reported in this column.
This piece of information is related to column 060 of the CR IRB template.
080-090
SUBSTITUTION OF THE EXPOSURE DUE TO CRM:
Inflows and outflows within the same exposure classes and, when relevant, risk weights or obligor grades shall also be reported.
080
(-) TOTAL OUTFLOWS
Article 236 of CRR.
Outflows correspond to the covered part of the “Exposure net of value adjustments and provisions”, that is deducted from the obligor’s exposure class and, when relevant, risk weight or obligor grade, and subsequently assigned to the protection provider’s exposure class and, when relevant, risk weight or obligor grade.
This amount shall be considered as an Inflow into the protection provider’s exposure class and, when relevant, risk weights or obligor grades.
This piece of information is related to column 070 of the CR IRB template.

120
FULLY ADJUSTED EXPOSURE VALUE (E*)
Securitisation positions according to Article 246 of CRR, therefore without applying the conversion factors laid down in Article 246(1) point (c) of CRR.
130-160
BREAKDOWN OF THE FULLY ADJUSTED EXPOSURE VALUE (E*) OF OFF BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ACCORDING TO CONVERSION FACTORS
Article 246(1) point (c) of CRR foresees that the exposure value of an off-balance sheet securitisation position shall be its nominal value multiplied by a conversion figure. This conversion figure shall be 100 % unless otherwise specified.
In this respect, Article 4(1)(56) of CRR defines conversion factor.
For reporting purposes, fully adjusted exposure values (E*) shall be reported according to the following four mutually exclusive intervals of conversion factors: 0 %, (0 %, 20 %], (20 %, 50 %] and (50 %, 100 %].
170
EXPOSURE VALUE
Securitisation positions according to Article 246 of CRR.
This piece of information is related to column 110 of the CR IRB template.
180
(-) EXPOSURE VALUE DEDUCTED FROM OWN FUNDS
Article 266(3) of CRR foresees that in case of a securitisation position in respect of which a 1 250  % risk weight applies, institutions may, as an alternative to including the position in their calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts, deduct from own funds the exposure value of the position.

EXPOSURE VALUE SUBJECT TO RISK WEIGHTS
200-320
RATINGS BASED METHOD (CREDIT QUALITY STEPS)
Article 261 of CRR.
IRB-Securitisation positions with an inferred rating according to Article 259(2) of CRR shall be reported as positions with a rating.

SUPERVISORY FORMULA METHOD
For the Supervisory Formula Method (SFM), Article 262 of CRR.
The risk weight for a securitisation position shall be the greater of 7 % or the risk weight to be applied in accordance with the formulas provided.
340
SUPERVSIORY FORMULA METHOD: AVERAGE RISK WEIGHT
Credit risk mitigation on securitisation positions may be recognised in accordance with Article 264 of CRR. In this case, the institution shall indicate the “effective risk weight” of the position when full protection has been received, according to what is established in Article 264(2) of CRR (the effective risk weight equals the risk-weighted exposure amount of the position divided by the exposure value of the position, multiplied by 100).
When the position benefits from partial protection, the institution must apply the Supervisory Formula Method using the “T” adjusted according to what is established in Article 264(3) of CRR.
Weighted average risk weights shall be reported in this column.
350
LOOK-THROUGH
The look-through columns comprise all the cases of unrated exposures where the risk weight is obtained from the underlying portfolio of exposures (highest risk weight of the pool).
Article 263(2) and (3) of CRR envisage an exceptional treatment where Kirb cannot be calculated.
The undrawn amount of the liquidity facilities shall be reported under “Off balance sheet items and derivatives”.
As long as an originator would be under the exceptional treatment where Kirb cannot be calculated, then column 350 would be the right column to use for the reporting of the risk weighting treatment given to the exposure value of a liquidity facility subject to the treatment laid down in Article 263 of CRR.
For early amortisations see Articles 256(5) and 265 of CRR.

430
ADJUSTMENT TO THE RISK-WEIGHTED EXPOSURE AMOUNT DUE TO MATURITY MISMATCHES
For maturity mismatches in synthetic securitisations RW*-RW(SP), as defined in Article 250 of CRR, shall be included, except in the case of tranches subject to a risk weighting of 1 250  % where the amount to be reported is zero. Note that RW(SP) not only includes the risk weighted exposure amounts reported under column 400 but also the risk weighted exposure amounts corresponding to exposures redistributed via outflows to other templates.

Originators, only, shall report the following abbreviations:
—
“N” not subject to own funds requirements;
—
“B” banking book;
—
“T” trading book;
—
“A” partly in both books.
Articles 109, 243 and 244 of CRR.
This column summarises the solvency treatment of the securitisation scheme by the originator. It indicates whether own funds requirements are computed according to securitised exposures or securitisation positions (banking book/trading book).
If own funds requirements are based on securitised exposures (for not being significant risk transfer) the computation of own funds requirements for credit risk shall be reported in the CR SA template, in case the Standardised Approach is used, or in the CR IRB template, in case the Internal Ratings Based Approach is used by the institution.
Conversely, if own funds requirements are based on securitisation positions held in the banking book (for being significant risk transfer) the computation of own funds requirements for credit risk shall be reported in the CR SEC SA template or in the CR SEC IRB template. In the case of securitisation positions held in the trading book the computation of own funds requirements for market risk shall be reported in the MKR SA TDI (standardised general position risk) and in the MKR SA SEC or MKR SA CTP (standardised specific position risk) or in the MKR IM (internal models) templates.

080
TYPE OF RETENTION APPLIED
For each securitisation scheme originated, it shall be reported the relevant type of retention of net economic interest, as envisaged in Article 405 of CRR:

A — Vertical slice (securitisation positions): “retention of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of each of the tranches sold or transferred to the investors”.

V — Vertical slice (securitised exposures): retention of no less than 5 % of the credit risk of each of the securitised exposures, if the credit risk thus retained with respect to such securitised exposures always ranks pari passu with, or is subordinated to, the credit risk that has been securitised with respect to those same exposures.

B — Revolving exposures: “in the case of securitisations of revolving exposures, retention of the originator’s interest of no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures”.

C — On-balance sheet: “retention of randomly selected exposures, equivalent to no less than 5 % of the nominal amount of the securitised exposures, where such exposures would otherwise have been securitised in the securitisation, provided that the number of potentially securitised exposures is no less than 100 at origination”.

D — First loss: “retention of the first loss tranche and, if necessary, other tranches having the same or a more severe risk profile than those transferred or sold to investors and not maturing any earlier than those transferred or sold to investors, so that the retention equals in total no less than 5 % of the nominal value of the securitised exposures”.

E — Exempted. This code shall be reported for those securitisations affected by provisions in Article 405(3) of CRR.

N — Not applicable. This code shall be reported for those securitisations affected by provisions in Article 404 of CRR.

U — In breach or unknown. This code shall be reported when the reporting does not know with certain which type of retention is being applied or in case of non-compliance.
090
% OF RETENTION AT REPORTING DATE
The retention of material net economic interest by the originator, sponsor or original lender of the securitisation shall be no less than 5 % (at origination date).
Notwithstanding Article 405(1) of CRR, measurement of retention at origination can typically be interpreted as being when the exposures were first securitised, and not when the exposures were first created (for instance, not when the underlying loans were first extended). Measurement of retention at origination means that 5 % is the retention percentage that is required at the point in time when such retention level was measured and the requirement fulfilled (for instance, when the exposures were first securitised); dynamic re-measurement and readjustment of the retained percentage throughout the life of the transaction is not required.
This column shall not be reported in case codes “E” (exempted) or “N” (not applicable) are reported under column 080 (Type of retention applied).
100
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RETENTION REQUIREMENT?
Article 405(1) of CRR.

120-130
NON ABCP PROGRAMS
Because of their special character because they comprise of several single securitisation positions, ABCP programs (defined in Article 242(9) of CRR) are exempted from reporting in columns 120 and 130.
120
ORIGINATION DATE (mm/yyyy)
The month and year of the origination date (i.e. cut-off or closing date of the pool) of the securitisation shall be reported according to the following format: “mm/yyyy”.
For each securitisation scheme the origination date cannot change between reporting dates. In the particular case of securitisation schemes backed by open pools, the origination date shall be the date of the first issuance of securities.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
130
TOTAL AMOUNT OF SECURITISED EXPOSURES AT ORIGINATION DATE
This column gathers the amount (according to original exposures pre conversion factors) of the securitised portfolio at the origination date.
In case of securitisation schemes backed by open pools the amount referring to the origination date of the first issuance of securities shall be reported. In the case of traditional securitisations no other assets of the securitisation pool shall be included. In the case of multi-seller securitisation schemes (i.e. with more than one originator) only the amount corresponding to the reporting entity’s contribution in the securitised portfolio shall be reported. In the case of the securitisation of liabilities only the amounts issued by the reporting entity shall be reported.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
140-220
SECURITISED EXPOSURES
Columns 140 to 220 request information on several features of the securitised portfolio by the reporting entity.
140
TOTAL AMOUNT
Institutions shall report the value of the securitised portfolio at reporting date, i.e. the outstanding amount of the securitised exposures. In the case of traditional securitisations no other assets of the securitisation pool shall be included. In the case of multi-seller securitisation schemes (i.e. with more than one originator) only the amount corresponding to the reporting entity’s contribution in the securitised portfolio shall be reported. In the case of securitisation schemes backed by closed pools (i.e. the portfolio of securitised assets cannot be enlarged after the origination date) the amount will progressively be reduced.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
150
INSTITUTION’S SHARE (%)
It shall be reported the institution’s share (percentage with two decimals) at reporting date in the securitised portfolio. The figure to be reported in this column is, by default, 100 % except for multi-seller securitisation schemes. In that case the reporting entity shall report its current contribution to the securitised portfolio (equivalent to column 140 in relative terms).
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
160
TYPE
This column gathers information on the type of assets (“1” to “8”) or liabilities (“9” and “10”) of the securitised portfolio. The institution must report one of the following number codes:

3 — Credit card receivables;

4 — Leasing;

5 — Loans to corporates or SMEs (treated as corporates);

6 — Consumer loans;

7 — Trade receivables;

8 — Other assets;

9 — Covered bonds;

10 — Other liabilities.
In case the pool of securitised exposures is a mix of the previous types, the institution shall indicate the most important type. In case of re-securitisations, the institution shall refer to the ultimate underlying pool of assets. Type “10” (Other liabilities) includes treasury bonds and credit linked notes.
For securitisation schemes backed by closed pools the type cannot change between reporting dates.
170
APPROACH APPLIED (SA/IRB/MIX)
This column gathers information on the approach that at reporting date the institution would apply to the securitised exposures.
Report the following abbreviations:
—
“S” for Standardised Approach;
—
“I” for Internal Ratings Based Approach;
—
“M” for a combination of both approaches (SA/IRB).
If under SA, “P” is reported in column 050 then the computation of own funds requirements shall be reported in the CR SEC SA template.
If under IRB, “P” is reported in column 050 then the computation of own funds requirements shall be reported in the CR SEC IRB template.
If under combination of SA and IRB, “P” is reported in column 050 then the computation of own funds requirements shall be reported in both the CR SEC SA and CR SEC IRB templates.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation. Nevertheless, this column does not apply to securitisations of liabilities. Sponsors shall not report this column.
180
NUMBER OF EXPOSURES
Article 261(1) of CRR.
This column is only compulsory for those institutions using the IRB approach to the securitisation positions (and, therefore, reporting “I” in column 170). The institution shall report the effective number of exposures.
This column shall not be reported in case of securitisation of liabilities or when the own funds requirements are based on the securitised exposures (in case of securitisation of assets). This column shall not be fulfilled when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation. This column shall not be fulfilled by investors.
190
COUNTRY
Report the code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) of the country of origin of the ultimate underlying of the transaction, i.e. the country of the immediate obligor of the original securitised exposures (look through). In case the pool of the securitisation consists of different countries, the institution shall indicate the most important country. If no country exceeds a 20 % threshold based on the amount of assets/liabilities, then “other countries” shall be reported.
200
ELGD (%)
The exposure-weighted average loss-given-default (ELGD) shall only be reported by those institutions applying the Supervisory Formula Method (and, therefore, reporting “I” in column 170). The ELGD is to be calculated as indicated in Article 262(1) of CRR.
This column shall not be reported in case of securitisation of liabilities or when the own funds requirements are based on the securitised exposures (in case of securitisation of assets). This column shall not be fulfilled either when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation. Sponsors shall not report this column.
210
(-) VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND PROVISIONS
Value adjustments and provisions (Article 159 of CRR) for credit losses made in accordance with the accounting framework to which the reporting entity is subject. Value adjustments include any amount recognized in profit or loss for credit losses of financial assets since their initial recognition in the balance sheet (including losses due to credit risk of financial assets measured at fair value that shall not be deducted from the exposure value) plus the discounts on exposures purchased when in default according to Article 166(1) of CRR. Provisions include accumulated amounts of credit losses in off-balance sheet items.
This column gathers information on the value adjustments and provisions applied to the securitised exposures. This column shall not be reported in case of securitisation of liabilities.
This piece of information shall be reported even when the reporting entity does not hold any positions in the securitisation.
Sponsors shall not report this column.

010-030
RELEVANT INDICATOR
Institutions using the relevant indicator to calculate the own funds requirement for operational risk (BIA, TSA and ASA) report relevant indicator for the respective years in columns 010 to 030. Moreover, in the case of a combined use of different approaches as referred in Article 314 of CRR, institutions also report, for information purposes, relevant indicator for the activities subject to AMA. It is also the case for all other AMA banks.
Hereafter, the term “relevant indicator” refers to “the sum of the elements” at the end of the financial year as defined in Article 316 point 1, Table1 of CRR.
If the institution has less than 3 years of data on “relevant indicator” available, the available historical data (audited figures) shall be assigned by priority to the corresponding columns in the table. If, for instance, historical data for only one year is available, it shall be reported in column 030. If it seems reasonable, the forward looking estimates shall then be included in column 020 (estimate of next year) and column 010 (estimate of year +2).
Furthermore if there are no historical data on “relevant indicator” available the institution may use forward-looking business estimates.
040-060
LOANS AND ADVANCES (IN THE CASE OF ASA APPLICATION)
These columns shall be used to report the amounts of the loans and advances for business lines “Commercial banking” and “Retail banking”, as referred to in Article 319(1) point (b) of CRR. These amounts shall be used to calculate the alternative relevant indicator that leads to the own funds requirements corresponding to the activities subject to ASA (Article 319(1) point (a) of CRR).
For the “commercial banking” business line, securities held in the non-trading book shall also be included.
070
OWN FUND REQUIREMENT
The own fund requirement is calculated according to the approach used, following Articles 312 to 324 of CRR The resulting amount is reported in column 070.
071
TOTAL OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE AMOUNT
Article 92(4) of CRR. Own funds requirements in column 070 multiplied by 12.5.

Article 18(1) of CRR (related to the inclusion, in the application referred to in Article 312(2) of CRR) of the methodology used for allocating operational risk capital between the different entities of the group and of whether and how diversification effects are intended to be factored in the risk measurement system used by a EU parent credit institution and its subsidiaries or jointly by the subsidiaries of an EU parent financial holding company or EU parent mixed financial holding company.
090-120
AMA MEMORANDUM ITEMS TO BE REPORTED IF APPLICABLE
090
OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENT BEFORE ALLEVIATION DUE TO EXPECTED LOSS, DIVERSIFICATION AND RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES
The own funds requirement reported in column 090 is the one of column 070 but calculated before taking into account the alleviation effects due to expected loss, diversification and risk mitigation techniques (see below).
100
(-) ALLEVIATION OF OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS DUE TO THE EXPECTED LOSS CAPTURED IN BUSINESS PRACTICES
In column 100 the alleviation of own funds requirements due to expected loss captured in internal business practices (as referred to in Article 322(2) point (a) of CRR) is reported.
110
(-) ALLEVIATION OF OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS DUE TO DIVERSIFICATION
The diversification effect in column 110 is the difference between the sum of own funds requirements calculated separately for each operational risk class (i.e. a “perfect dependence” situation) and the diversified own funds requirement calculated by taking into account correlations and dependencies (i.e. assuming less than “perfect dependence” between the risk classes). The “perfect dependence” situation occurs in the “default case”, that is when the institution does not use explicit correlations structure between the risk classes, hence the AMA capital is computed as the sum of the individual operational risk measures of the chosen risk classes. In this case the correlation between the risk classes is assumed of 100 % and the value in the column has to be set to zero. Conversely, when the institution computes an explicit correlations structure between risk classes, it has to include in this column the difference between the AMA capital as stemming from the “default case” and that obtained after applying the correlations structure between the risk classes. The value reflects the “diversification capacity” of the AMA model, that is the ability of the model to capture the not simultaneous occurrence of severe operational risk loss events. In the column 110 the amount by which the assumed correlation structure decreases the AMA capital relative to the assumption of 100 % correlation has to be reported.
120
(-) ALLEVIATION OF OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENT DUE TO RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES (INSURANCE AND OTHER RISK TRANSFER MECHANISMS)
In column 120 the impact of insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms according to Article 323(1) to (5) of CRR is reported.

For a loss event that affects more than one business line the “gross loss amount” is distributed among all the affected business lines.
Institutions that calculate their own funds requirement according to BIA can report those losses for which the business line is not identified in rows 910-980 only.
0010, 0110, 0210, 0310, 0410, 0510, 0610, 0710, 0810
Number of events (new events)
The number of events is the number of operational risk events for which gross losses were accounted for within the reporting reference period.
The number of events shall refer to “new events”, i.e. operational risk events
(i)
“accounted for the first time” within the reporting reference period or
(ii)
“accounted for the first time” within a previous reporting reference period, if the event had not been included in any previous supervisory report, e.g. because it was identified as operational risk event only in the current reporting reference period or because the accumulated loss attributable to that event (i.e. the original loss plus/minus all loss adjustments made in previous reporting reference periods) exceeded the internal data collection threshold only in the current reporting reference period.
“New events” do not include operational risk events “accounted for the first time” within a previous reporting reference period, which had been included already in previous supervisory reports.
0020, 0120, 0220, 0320, 0420, 0520, 0620, 0720, 0820
Gross loss amount (new events)
The gross loss amount is the gross loss amounts pertinent to operational risk events (e.g. direct charges, provisions, settlements). All losses related to a single event which are accounted for within the reporting reference period are summed up and considered as the gross loss for that event for that reporting reference period.
The reported gross loss amount shall refer to “new events” as defined in the row above. For events “accounted for the first time” within a previous reporting reference period which had not been included in any previous supervisory report, the total loss accumulated until the reporting reference date (i.e. the original loss plus/minus all loss adjustments made in previous reporting reference periods) shall be reported as the gross loss at the reporting reference date.
The amounts to be reported do not take into account obtained recoveries.
0030, 0130, 0230, 0330, 0430, 0530, 0630, 0730, 0830
Number of loss events subject to loss adjustments
The number of loss events subject to loss adjustments is the number of operational risk events “accounted for the first time” in previous reporting reference periods and already included in previous reports, for which loss adjustments were made in the current reporting reference period.
If more than one loss adjustment was made for an event within the reporting reference period, the sum of those loss adjustments shall be counted as one adjustment in the period.
0040, 0140, 0240, 0340, 0440, 0540, 0640, 0740, 0840
Loss adjustments relating to previous reporting periods
Loss adjustments relating to previous reporting reference periods is the sum of the following elements (positive or negative):
(i)
the gross loss amounts pertinent to positive loss adjustments made within the reporting reference period (e.g. increase of provisions, linked loss events, additional settlements) of operational risk events “accounted for the first time” and reported in previous reporting reference periods;
(ii)
the gross loss amounts pertinent to negative loss adjustments made within the reporting reference period (e.g. due to decrease of provisions) of operational risk events “accounted for the first time” and reported in previous reporting reference periods.
If more than one loss adjustment was made for an event within the reporting reference period, the amounts of all those loss adjustments are summed up, taking into account the sign of the adjustments (positive, negative). This sum is considered as the loss adjustment for that event for that reporting reference period.
If, due to a negative loss adjustment, the adjusted loss amount attributable to an event falls below the internal data collection threshold of the institution, the institution shall report the total loss amount for that event accumulated until the last time when the event was reported for a December reference date (i.e. the original loss plus/minus all loss adjustments made in previous reporting reference periods) with a negative sign instead of the amount of the negative loss adjustment itself.
The amounts to be reported do not take into account obtained recoveries.

(i)
the largest gross loss amount related to an event reported for the first time within the reporting reference period and
(ii)
the largest positive loss adjustment amount (as defined above) related to an event reported for the first time within a previous reporting reference period.
The amounts to be reported do not take into account obtained recoveries.

Sum of the five largest losses
The sum of the five largest losses is the sum of the five largest amounts among
(i)
the gross loss amounts for events reported for the first time within the reporting reference period and
(ii)
the positive loss adjustment amounts (as defined for rows 040, 140, …, 840 above) relating to events reported for the first time within a previous reporting reference period. The amount which can qualify as one of the five largest ones is the amount of the loss adjustment itself, not the total loss associated with the respective event before or after the loss adjustment.
The amounts to be reported do not take into account obtained recoveries.
0070, 0170, 0270, 0370, 0470, 0570, 0670, 0770, 0870
Total direct loss recovery
Direct recoveries are all recoveries obtained except those which are subject to Article 323 CRR as reported in the row below.
The total direct loss recovery is the sum of all the direct recoveries and adjustments to direct recoveries accounted for within the reporting period and pertinent to operational risk events accounted for the first time within the reporting reference period or in previous reporting reference periods.

The total recovery from insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms is the sum of all the recoveries from insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms and adjustments to such recoveries accounted within the reporting reference period and pertinent to operational risk events accounted for the first time within the reporting reference period or in previous reporting reference periods.
0910-0980
TOTAL BUSINESS LINES
For each event type (column 010 to 080), the information (Article 322(3) lit. b), c) and e) of CRR on total business lines has to be reported.
0910-0914
Number of Events
In row 910, the number of events above the internal threshold by event types for the total business lines shall be reported. This figure may be lower than the aggregation of the number of events by business lines since the events with multiple impacts (impacts in different business lines) shall be considered as one. It may be higher, if an institution calculating its own funds requirements according to BIA cannot identify the business line(s) affected by the loss in every case.
In rows 911 – 914, the number of events with a gross loss amount within the ranges defined in the pertinent rows shall be reported.
Provided that the institution has assigned all its losses either to a business line listed in Article 317(4) table 2 CRR or the business line “Corporate items” as referred to in Article 322(3) point (b) CRR respectively that it has identified the event types for all losses, the following shall apply for column 080:
—
The total number of events reported in rows 910 to 914 is equal to the horizontal aggregation of the number of events in the corresponding row, given that in those figures the events with impacts in different business lines shall have already been considered as one event.
—
The figure reported in column 080, row 910 shall not necessarily be equal to the vertical aggregation of the number of events which are included in column 080, given that one event can have an impact in different business lines simultaneously.
0920-0924
Gross loss amount (new events)
Provided that the institution has assigned all its losses either to a business line listed in Article 317(4) table 2 CRR or the business line “Corporate items” as referred to in Article 322(3) point (b) CRR, the gross loss amount (new events) reported in row 920 is the simple aggregation of the gross loss amounts of new events for each business line.
In rows 921 – 924, the gross loss amount for events with a gross loss amount within the ranges defined in the pertinent rows shall be reported.
0930, 0935, 0936
Number of loss events subject to loss adjustments
In row 930, the total of the numbers of events subject to loss adjustments as defined for rows 030, 130, …, 830 shall be reported. This figure may be lower than the aggregation of the number of events subject to loss adjustments by business lines since events with multiple impacts (impacts in different business lines) shall be considered as one. It may be higher, if an institution calculating its own funds requirements according to BIA cannot identify the business line(s) affected by the loss in every case.
The number of loss events subject to loss adjustments shall be broken down into the number of events for which a positive loss adjustment was made within the reporting reference period and the number of events for which a negative loss adjustment was made within the reporting period (all reported with a positive sign).
0940, 0945, 0946
Loss adjustments relating to previous reporting periods
In row 940, the total of the loss adjustment amounts relating to previous reporting periods per business lines (as defined for rows 040, 140, …, 840) shall be reported. Provided that the institution has assigned all its losses either to a business line listed in Article 317(4) table 2 of CRR or the business line “Corporate items” as referred to in Article 322(3) point (b) of CRR, the amount reported in row 940 is the simple aggregation of the loss adjustments relating to previous reporting periods reported for the different business lines.
The amount of loss adjustments shall be broken down into the amount related to events for which a positive loss adjustment was made in the reporting reference period (row 945, reported with as positive figure) and the amount related to events for which a negative loss adjustment was made within the reporting period (row 946, reported as negative figure). If, due to a negative loss adjustment, the adjusted loss amount attributable to an event falls below the internal data collection threshold of the institution, the institution shall report the total loss amount for that event accumulated until the last time when the event was reported for a December reference date (i.e. the original loss plus/minus all loss adjustments made in previous reporting reference periods) with a negative sign in row 946 instead of the amount of the negative loss adjustment itself.

Unadjusted difference amounts refer to unadjusted differences between the trading system generated valuations and the valuations assessed during the monthly IPV process.
No adjusted difference amounts in the books and records of the institution for the relevant month end date shall be included in the calculation of IPV difference.
0170 - 0250
FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS
Adjustments, sometimes also referred to as “reserves”, potentially applied in the institution’s accounting fair value that are made outside of the valuation model used to generate carrying amounts (excluding Deferral of day one gains and losses) and that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the relevant AVA. They could reflect risk factors not captured within the valuation technique, that are in a form of a risk premium or exit cost and are compliant with the definition of Fair value. They should nevertheless be considered by market participants when setting a price. (IFRS 13.9 and IFRS13.88)
0170
MARKET PRICE UNCERTAINTY
Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect the risk premium arising from the existence of a range of observed prices for equivalent instruments or, in respect of a market parameter input to a valuation model, the instruments from which the input has been calibrated, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the Market price uncertainty AVA.
0180
CLOSE-OUT COSTS
Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to adjust for the fact that the position level valuations do not reflect an exit price for the position or portfolio, in particular where such valuations are calibrated to a mid-market price, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the Close-out costs AVA.
0190
MODEL RISK
Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect market or product factors that are not captured by the model used to calculate daily position values and risks (“valuation model”) or to reflect an appropriate level of prudence given the uncertainty arising from the existence of a range of alternative valid models and model calibrations, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the Model risk AVA.
0200
CONCENTRATED POSITIONS
Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect the fact that the aggregate position held by the institution is larger than normal traded volume or larger than the position sizes on which observable quotes or trades that are used to calibrate the price or inputs used by the valuation model are based, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the Concentrated positions AVA.
0210
UNEARNED CREDIT SPREADS
Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to cover expected losses due to counterparty default on derivative positions (i.e. total Credit Valuation Adjustment “CVA” at institution level).
0220
INVESTING AND FUNDING COSTS
Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to compensate where valuation models do not fully reflect the funding cost that market participants would factor into the exit price for a position or portfolio (i.e. total Funding Valuation Adjustment at institution level where an institution computes such adjustment, or alternatively, equivalent adjustment).
0230
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION COSTS
Adjustment applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect administrative costs that are incurred by the portfolio or position but are not reflected in the valuation model or the prices used to calibrate inputs to that model, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the Future administrative costs AVA.
0240
EARLY TERMINATION
Adjustments applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect contractual or non-contractual early termination expectations that are not reflected in the valuation model, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the Early termination AVA.
0250
OPERATIONAL RISK
Adjustments applied in the institution’s fair value to reflect the risk premium that market participants would charge to compensate for operational risks arising from hedging, administration and settlement of contracts in the portfolio, and thus that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the Operational risk AVA.
0260
DAY 1 P&L
Adjustments to reflect instances where the valuation model plus all other relevant fair value adjustments applicable to a position or portfolio did not reflect the price paid or received at first day recognition, i.e. the deferral of day one gains and losses (IFRS 9.B5.1.2.A).

1.1   PORTFOLIOS UNDER ARTICLES 9 TO 17 — TOTAL CATEGORY LEVEL POST-DIVERSIFICATION
Article 7(2)(a) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation
For each relevant category of AVAs referred to in columns 0 010  to 0 110 , total AVAs computed according to Articles 9 to 17 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation for fair-valued assets and liabilities included in the threshold computation in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation, except fair-valued assets and liabilities subject to the treatment described in Article 7(2)(b) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation.
This includes the AVAs computed in accordance with Articles 12 and 13 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation that are reported in rows 0 050  and 0 060  and are included in market price uncertainty AVAs, close-out costs AVAs and model risk AVAs as set out in Articles 12(2) and 13(2) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation.
This includes the diversification benefits reported in row 0 140  in accordance with Articles 9(6), 10(7) and 11(7) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation.
Row 0 030  is therefore expected to be the difference between rows 0 040  and 0 140 .
0040 - 0130
1.1.1   TOTAL CATEGORY LEVEL PRE-DIVERSIFICATION
For rows 0 090  to 0 130 , institutions shall allocate their fair-valued assets and liabilities included in the threshold computation in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation (trading book and non-trading book) according to the following risk categories: interest rates, foreign exchange, credit, equities, commodities.
To this end, institutions shall rely on their internal risk management structure and, following a mapping developed based on expert judgement, allocate their business lines or trading desks to the most appropriate risk category. AVAs, Fair Value Adjustments and other required information, which correspond to the allocated business lines or trading desks, shall then be allocated to the same relevant risk category, in order to provide at row level for each risk category a consistent overview of the adjustments performed both for prudential purposes and accounting purposes, as well as an indication of the size of the positions concerned (in terms of fair-valued assets and liabilities). Where AVAs or other adjustments are computed at a different level of aggregation, in particular at firm level, institutions shall develop an allocation methodology of the AVAs to the relevant sets of positions. The allocation methodology shall lead to row 0 040  being the sum of rows 0 050  to 0 130  for columns 0 010  to 0 100 .
Regardless of the approach applied, the information reported shall, as much as possible, be consistent at row level, since the information provided will be compared at this level (AVA amounts, upside uncertainty, fair-value amounts and potential fair-value adjustments).
The breakdown in rows 0 090  to 0 130  excludes the AVAs computed in accordance with Articles 12 and 13 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation that are reported in rows 0 050  and 0 060  and are included in market price uncertainty AVAs, close-out costs AVAs and model risk AVAs as set out in Articles 12(2) and 13(2) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation.
Diversification benefits are reported in row 0 140  in accordance with Articles 9(6), 10(7) and 11(7) of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 on prudent valuation and are therefore excluded from rows 0 040  to 0 130 .

(a)
under IFRS and national GAAP based on BAD for debt instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss without being included in the held for trading or trading portfolio, the gross carrying amount shall depend on whether they are classified as performing or non-performing. For performing debt instruments, the gross carrying amount shall be the fair value. For non-performing debt instruments, the gross carrying amount shall be the fair value after adding back any accumulated negative fair value adjustment due to credit risk, as defined in paragraph 69 of Part 2 of this Annex. For the purpose of the measurement of the gross carrying amount, the valuation of the debt instruments shall be performed on the level of single financial instruments;
(b)
under IFRS for debt instruments at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, the gross carrying amount shall be the carrying amount before adjusting for any loss allowance;
(c)
under national GAAP based on BAD, for debt instruments classified as “non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at a cost-based method”, the gross carrying amount of impaired assets shall be equal to the carrying amount before adjusting for specific allowances for credit risk. The gross carrying amount of unimpaired assets shall be the carrying amount before adjusting for general allowances for credit risk and general allowances for banking risk, where affecting the carrying amount;
(d)
under national GAAP based on BAD, the gross carrying amount of debt instruments classified as “Non-trading non-derivative financial assets measured at fair value to equity” shall depend on whether these financial assets are subject to impairment requirements. Where they are subject to impairment requirements, the gross carrying amount shall be the carrying amount before adjusting for any accumulated impairment, following the requirements in point (c) above for impaired and unimpaired assets, or any accumulated amount of fair value adjustment that is considered as impairment loss. When these financial assets are not subject to impairment requirements, the gross carrying amount of these financial assets shall be the fair value for performing exposures, and for non-performing exposures the fair value after adding back any accumulated negative fair value adjustment due to credit risk;
(e)
under national GAAP based on BAD, the gross carrying amount of debt instruments measured at strict or moderate LOCOM shall be the cost where measured at cost during the reporting period. Where these debt instruments are measured at market value the gross carrying amount shall be the market value before adjusting for credit-risk induced value adjustments;
(f)
under national GAAP based on BAD, for debt instruments reported under “Other non-trading non-derivative financial assets” under measurement methods other than LOCOM, the gross carrying amount shall be the carrying amount before taking into account any valuation adjustment that qualifies as impairment;
(g)
for trading financial assets under GAAP based on BAD or held for trading financial assets under IFRS, the gross carrying amount shall be the fair value. Where GAAP based on BAD require haircuts on trading and fair valued instruments, the carrying amount of the financial instruments shall be the fair value before these haircuts.

(a)
for debt instruments measured at amortised cost or at a cost-based method, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised, where appropriate for each of the impairment stages. Accumulated impairment reduces the carrying amount of the debt instrument through the use of an allowance account under IFRS and national GAAP based on BAD, or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event under national GAAP based on BAD;
(b)
for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income under IFRS, accumulated impairment is the sum of expected credit losses and their variations recognised as a reduction of fair value on a given instrument since initial recognition;
(c)
for debt instruments at fair value through equity under national GAAP based on BAD subject to impairment, accumulated impairment is the cumulative amount of impairment losses, net of use and reversals that has been recognised. The reduction in the carrying amount is either made through use of an allowance account or via direct reductions that do not constitute a derecognition event.

10.1.   Classification Of Derivatives By Type Of Risk
129.
(a)
interest rate: Interest rate derivatives shall be contracts related to an interest-bearing financial instrument whose cash flows are determined by referencing interest rates or another interest rate contract such as an option on a futures contract to purchase a Treasury bill. This category shall be restricted to those deals where all the legs are exposed to only one currency’s interest rate. Thus it shall exclude contracts involving the exchange of one or more foreign currencies such as cross-currency swaps and currency options, and other contracts whose predominant risk characteristic is foreign exchange risk, which are to be reported as foreign exchange contracts. The only exception is where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, where they shall be reported in the dedicated rows for these types of hedges. Interest rate contracts shall include forward rate agreements, single-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate futures, interest rate options (including caps, floors, collars and corridors), interest rate swaptions and interest rate warrants;
(b)
equity: Equity derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of a particular equity or to an index of equity prices;
(c)
foreign exchange and gold: These derivatives shall include contracts involving the exchange of currencies in the forward market and the exposure to gold. They therefore shall cover outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps, currency swaps (including cross-currency interest rate swaps), currency futures, currency options, currency swaptions and currency warrant. Foreign exchange derivatives shall include all deals involving exposure to more than one currency, whether in exchange rates or in interest rates except where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk. Gold contracts shall include all deals involving exposure to that commodity;
(d)
credit: Credit derivatives shall be contracts in which the payout is linked primarily to some measure of the creditworthiness of a particular reference credit and that do not meet the definition of financial guarantees [IFRS 9]. The contracts shall specify an exchange of payments in which at least one of the two legs is determined by the performance of the reference credit. Payouts can be triggered by a number of events, including a default, a rating downgrade or a stipulated change in the credit spread of the reference asset. Credit derivatives that meet the definition of a financial guarantee in paragraph 114 of this Part of this Annex shall be reported only in template 9;
(e)
commodity: These derivatives shall be contracts that have a return, or a portion of their return, linked to the price of, or to a price index of, a commodity such as a precious metal (other than gold), petroleum, lumber or agricultural products
(f)
other: These derivatives shall be any other derivative contracts, which do not involve an exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, commodity or credit risk such as climatic derivatives or insurance derivatives.
130.
(a)
commodities: All derivatives transactions involving a commodity or commodity index exposure, whether or not they involve a joint exposure in commodities and any other risk category which may include foreign exchange, interest rate or equity, shall be reported in this category;
(b)
equities: With the exception of contracts with a joint exposure to commodities and equities, which are to be reported as commodities, all derivatives transactions with a link to the performance of equities or equity indices shall be reported in the equity category. Equity deals with exposure to foreign exchange or interest rates shall be included in this category;
(c)
foreign exchange and gold: This category shall include all derivatives transactions (with the exception of those already reported in the commodity or equity categories) with exposure to more than one currency, be it pertaining either to interest-bearing financial instruments or exchange rates except where cross-currency swaps are used as part of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk.
10.2.   Amounts to be reported for derivatives
131.
132.
133.
(a)
for contracts with variable nominal or notional principal amounts, the basis for reporting shall be the nominal or notional principal amounts at the reference date;
(b)
the notional amount value to be reported for a derivative contract with a multiplier component shall be the contract effective notional amount or par value;
(c)
swaps: The notional amount of a swap shall be the underlying principal amount upon which the exchange of interest, foreign exchange or other income or expense is based;
(d)
equity and commodity-linked contracts: The notional amount to be reported for an equity or commodity contract shall be the quantity of the commodity or equity product contracted for purchase or sale multiplied by the contract price of a unit. The notional amount to be reported for commodity contracts with multiple exchanges of principal shall be the contractual amount multiplied by the number of remaining exchanges of principal in the contract;
(e)
credit derivatives: The contract amount to be reported for credit derivatives shall be the nominal value of the relevant reference credit;
(f)
digital options have a predefined payoff which can be either a monetary amount or a number of contracts of an underlying. The notional amount for digital options shall be defined as either the predefined monetary amount or the fair value of the underlying at the reference date.

Maturity buckets of the exposure
Article 394(2)(e) of CRR
The institution shall report this information for the ten largest exposures to institutions and the ten largest exposures to unregulated financial sector entities.
The maturity buckets are defined with a monthly interval up to one year, with a quarterly interval from one year up to three years and with larger intervals from three years onwards.
Each exposure value before application of exemptions and CRM (column 210 of LE2 template) shall be reported with the whole outstanding amount in the respective maturity bucket of its expected residual maturity. In case of several separate relationships constituting an exposure to a client, each of these parts of the exposure shall be reported with the whole outstanding amount in the respective maturity bucket of its expected residual maturity. Instruments which do not have a fixed maturity, like equity, shall be included in the column “undefined maturity”.
The expected maturity of the exposure shall be reported for both direct and indirect exposures.
For direct exposures, when allocating expected amounts of debt instruments and derivatives into the different maturity buckets of this template, the instructions of the maturity ladder template of the additional metrics on liquidity shall be used (see Annex XXIII to this Regulation).
In the case of off-balance sheet items, the maturity of the underlying risk shall be used in the allocation of expected amounts to maturity buckets. More specifically, for forward deposits that means the maturity structure of the deposit; for financial guarantees, the maturity structure of the underlying financial asset; for undrawn facilities of loan commitments, the maturity structure of the loan; and for other commitments, the maturing structure of the commitment.
In the case of indirect exposures, the allocation into maturity buckets shall be based on the maturity of the guaranteed operations which generate the direct exposure.
In case an exposure or a part of an exposure is to be regarded as defaulted and is reported as such in template C 28.00 (LE 2, column 050) and C 29.00 (LE 3, column 060), the expected run-off of the defaulted exposure must be allocated to the respective maturity buckets as follows:
—
When the reporting entity, in spite of the default, has a clear calendar of expected repayments of the exposure, it shall allocate them into the respective buckets accordingly.
—
When the reporting entity does not have a reasoned view of when defaulted amounts will be repaid (if ever), it shall allocate them into the category “undefined maturity”.

The “Counterbalancing Capacity” of the maturity ladder shall contain information on the development of an institution’s holdings of assets of varying degrees of liquidity, amongst which tradable assets and central bank eligible assets, as well as facilities contractually committed to the institution.
For reporting at the consolidated level on central bank eligibility, the rules of central bank eligibility which apply to each consolidated institution in its jurisdiction of incorporation shall form the basis.
Where the counterbalancing capacity refers to tradable assets, institutions shall report tradable assets traded in large, deep and active repo or cash markets characterised by a low level of concentration.
Assets reported in the columns of the counterbalancing capacity shall include only unencumbered assets available to the institution to convert into cash at any time to fill contractual gaps between cash inflows and outflows during the time horizon. For those purposes, the definition of encumbered assets in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 shall apply. The assets shall not be used to provide credit enhancements in structured transactions or to cover operational costs, such as rents and salaries, and shall be managed with the clear and sole intent for use as a source of contingent funds.
Assets that the institution received as collateral in reverse repo and Securities Financing Transactions (SFT) can be considered as part of the counterbalancing capacity if they are held at the institution, have not been rehypothecated, and are legally and contractually available for the institution’s use.
In order to avoid double counting, where the institution reports prepositioned assets in item 3.1 to 3.7, it shall not report the related capacity of those facilities in item 3.8.
Institutions shall report assets, where they meet the description of a row and are available at the reporting date, as an initial stock in column 010.
Columns 020 to 220 shall contain contractual flows in the counterbalancing capacity. Where an institution has entered into a repo transaction, the asset which has been repoed out shall be re-entered as a security inflow in the maturity bucket where the repo transaction matures. Correspondingly, the cash outflow following from the maturing repo shall be reported in the relevant cash outflow bucket in item 1.2. Where an institution has entered into a reverse repo transaction, the asset which has been repoed in shall be re- entered as a security outflow in the maturity bucket where the repo transaction matures. Correspondingly, the cash inflow following from the maturing repo shall be reported in the relevant cash inflow bucket in item 2.1. Collateral swaps shall be reported as contractual inflows and outflows of securities in the counterbalancing capacity section in accordance with the relevant maturity bucket in which these swaps mature.
A change to the contractually available amount of credit and liquidity lines reported in item 3.8 shall be reported as a flow in the relevant time bucket. Where an institution has an overnight deposit at a central bank, the amount of the deposit shall be reported as an initial stock in item 3.2 and as a cash outflow in the maturity bucket “overnight” for this item. Correspondingly, the resultant cash inflow shall be reported in item 2.2.5.
Maturing securities in the counterbalancing capacity shall be reported based on their contractual maturity. When a security matures, it shall be removed from the asset category it was initially reported in, it shall be treated as an outflow of securities, and the resultant cash inflow shall be reported in item 2.5.
All security values shall be reported in the relevant bucket at current market values.
In item 3.8 only contractually available amounts shall be reported.
To avoid double counting, cash-inflows shall not be accounted for in item 3.1 or 3.2 of the counterbalancing capacity.
Items in the counterbalancing capacity shall be reported in the following sub- categories below:
