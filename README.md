# Statistical approach to arbitrarily long term extractionfrom domain specific texts

## Introduction
This repo contains experimental code for complex terminology extraction.
This algorithm can extract arbitrarily long terms (1 to +inf words) from texts.
It works at the document level through composition of smaller extracted terms.

The system also includes an acronym extraction mechanism through a simple heuristic.

## Setup
Lib needed :

contractions<br/>
NLTK (& its stopwords corpus)<br/>

## How to use
